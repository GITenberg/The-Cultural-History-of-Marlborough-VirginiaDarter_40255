<p>The scholarly and scientific publications of the United States National Museum
include two series, <i>Proceedings of the United States National Museum</i> and <i>United States
National Museum Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p>In these series, the Museum publishes original articles and monographs dealing
with the collections and work of its constituent museums&mdash;The Museum of Natural
History and the Museum of History and Technology&mdash;setting forth newly acquired
facts in the fields of anthropology, biology, history, geology, and technology. Copies
of each publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and scientific organizations,
and to specialists and others interested in the different subjects.</p>

<p>The <i>Proceedings</i>, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate form,
of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History. These are gathered in volumes,
octavo in size, with the publication date of each paper recorded in the table of contents
of the volume.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bulletin</i> series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear longer, separate
publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts) and volumes in
which are collected works on related subjects. <i>Bulletins</i> are either octavo or quarto in
size, depending on the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the
botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been published in the
<i>Bulletin</i> series under the heading <i>Contributions from the United States National Herbarium</i>,
and since 1959, in <i>Bulletins</i> titled "Contributions from the Museum of History and
Technology," have been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections and
research of that Museum.</p>

<p>This work forms volume 253 of the <i>Bulletin</i> series.</p>

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>A number of people participated in the preparation
of this study. The inspiration for the archeological
and historical investigations came from Professor
Oscar H. Darter, who until 1960 was chairman of
the Department of Historical and Social Sciences at
Mary Washington College, the women&#8217;s branch of
the University of Virginia. The actual excavations
were made under the direction of Frank M. Setzler,
formerly the head curator of anthropology at the
Smithsonian Institution. None of the investigation
would have been possible had not the owners of the
property permitted the excavations to be made,
sometimes at considerable inconvenience to themselves.
I am indebted to W. Biscoe, Ralph Whitticar,
Jr., and Thomas Ashby, all of whom owned the excavated
areas at Marlborough; and T. Ben Williams,
whose cornfield includes the site of the 18th-century
Stafford County courthouse, south of Potomac Creek.</p>

<p>For many years Dr. Darter has been a resident of
Fredericksburg and, in the summers, of Marlborough
Point on the Potomac River. During these years,
he has devoted himself to the history of the Stafford
County area which lies between these two locations
in northeastern Virginia. Marlborough Point has
interested Dr. Darter especially since it is the site of
one of the Virginia colonial port towns designated
by Act of Assembly in 1691. During the town&#8217;s
brief existence, it was the location of the Stafford
County courthouse and the place where the colonial
planter and lawyer John Mercer established his
home in 1726. Tangible evidence of colonial
activities at Marlborough Point&mdash;in the form of
brickbats and potsherds still can be seen after
each plowing, while John Mercer&#8217;s &#8220;Land Book,&#8221;
examined anew by Dr. Darter, has revealed the original
survey plats of the port town.</p>

<p>In this same period and as early as 1938, Dr. T.
Dale Stewart (then curator of physical anthropology
at the Smithsonian Institution) had commenced
excavations at the Indian village site of Patawomecke,
a few hundred yards west of the Marlborough Town
site. The aboriginal backgrounds of the area including
Marlborough Point already had been investigated.
As the result of his historical research connected with
this project, Dr. Stewart has contributed fundamentally
to the present undertaking by foreseeing the
excavations of Marlborough Town as a logical step
beyond his own investigation.</p>

<p>Motivated by this combination of interests, circumstances,
and historical clues, Dr. Darter invited the
Smithsonian Institution to participate in an archeological
investigation of Marlborough. Preliminary
tests made in August 1954 were sufficiently rewarding
to justify such a project. Consequently, an application
for funds was prepared jointly and was submitted
by Dr. Darter through the University of Virginia to
the American Philosophical Society. In January
1956 grant number 159, Johnson Fund (1955), for
$1500 was assigned to the program. In addition, the
Smithsonian Institution contributed the professional
services necessary for field research and directed the
purchase of microfilms and photostats, the drawing
of maps and illustrations, and the preparation and
publication of this report. Dr. Darter hospitably
provided the use of his Marlborough Point cottage
during the period of excavation, and Mary Washington
College administered the grant. Frank Setzler
directed the excavations during a six-week period in
April and May 1956, while interpretation of cultural
material and the searches of historical data related to
it were carried out by C. Malcolm Watkins.</p>

<p>At the commencement of archeological work it was
expected that traces of the 17th- and early 18th-century
town would be found, including, perhaps,
the foundations of the courthouse. This expectation
was not realized, although what was found from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Mercer period proved to be of greater importance.
After completion, a report was made in the 1956
<i>Year Book</i> of the American Philosophical Society
(pp. 304-308).</p>

<p>After the 1956 excavations, the question remained
whether the principal foundation (Structure B) might
not have been that of the courthouse. Therefore, in
August 1957 a week-long effort was made to find
comparative evidence by digging the site of the
succeeding 18th-century Stafford County courthouse
at the head of Potomac Creek. This disclosed a
foundation sufficiently different from Structure B to
rule out any analogy between the two.</p>

<p>It should be made clear that&mdash;because of the limited
size of the grant&mdash;the archeological phase of the investigation
was necessarily a limited survey. Only the
more obvious features could be examined within the
means at the project&#8217;s disposal. No final conclusions
relative to Structure B, for example, are warranted
until the section of foundation beneath the highway
which crosses it can be excavated. Further excavations
need to be made south and southeast of Structure
B and elsewhere in search of outbuildings and evidence
of 17th-century occupancy.</p>

<p>Despite such limitations, this study is a detailed
examination of a segment of colonial Virginia&#8217;s
plantation culture. It has been prepared with the
hope that it will provide Dr. Darter with essential
material for his area studies and, also, with the wider
objective of increasing the knowledge of the
material culture of colonial America. Appropriate
to the function of a museum such as the Smithsonian,
this study is concerned principally with what is
concrete&mdash;objects and artifacts and the meanings
that are to be derived from them. It has relied upon
the mutually dependent techniques of archeologist
and cultural historian and will serve, it is hoped, as
a guide to further investigations of this sort by historical
museums and organizations.</p>

<p>Among the many individuals contributing to this
study, I am especially indebted to Dr. Darter; to the
members of the American Philosophical Society who
made the excavations possible; to Dr. Stewart, who
reviewed the archeological sections at each step as
they were written; to Mrs. Sigrid Hull who drew the
line-and-stipple illustrations which embellish the
report; Edward G. Schumacher of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, who made the archeological
maps and drawings; Jack Scott of the Smithsonian
photographic laboratory, who photographed the artifacts;
and George Harrison Sanford King of Fredericksburg,
from whom the necessary documentation
for the 18th-century courthouse site was obtained.</p>

<p>I am grateful also to Dr. Anthony N. B. Garvan,
professor of American civilization at the University
of Pennsylvania and former head curator of the
Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s department of civil history,
for invaluable encouragement and advice; and to
Worth Bailey formerly with the Historic American
Buildings Survey, for many ideas, suggestions, and important
identifications of craftsmen listed in Mercer&#8217;s
ledgers.</p>

<p>I am equally indebted to Ivor Noël Hume, director
of archeology at Colonial Williamsburg and an
honorary research associate of the Smithsonian Institution,
for his assistance in the identification of
artifacts; to Mrs. Mabel Niemeyer, librarian of the
Bucks County Historical Society, for her cooperation
in making the Mercer ledgers available for this report;
to Donald E. Roy, librarian of the Darlington
Library, University of Pittsburgh, for providing the
invaluable clue that directed me to the ledgers; to
the staffs of the Virginia State Library and the Alexandria
Library for repeated courtesies and cooperation;
and to Miss Rodris Roth, associate curator of
cultural history at the Smithsonian, for detecting
Thomas Oliver&#8217;s inventory of Marlborough in a least
suspected source.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate receiving generous permissions
from the University of Pittsburgh Press to quote extensively
from the <i>George Mercer Papers Relating to
the Ohio Company of Virginia</i>, and from Russell &amp;
Russell to copy Thomas Oliver&#8217;s inventory of
Marlborough.</p>

<p>To all of these people and to the countless others
who contributed in one way or another to the
completion of this study, I offer my grateful thanks.</p>

Origins of Marlborough</i></h3>


<p class="title">ESTABLISHING THE PORT TOWNS</p>

<p>The dependence of 17th-century Virginia upon
the single crop&mdash;tobacco&mdash;was a chronic problem.
A bad crop year or a depressed English market could
plunge the whole colony into debt, creating a chain
reaction of overextended credits and failures to meet
obligations. Tobacco exhausted the soil, and soil
exhaustion led to an ever-widening search for new
land. This in turn brought about population
dispersal and extreme decentralization.</p>

<p>After the Restoration in 1660 the Virginia colonial
government was faced not only with these economic
hazards but also with the resulting administrative
difficulties. It was awkward to govern a scattered
population and almost impossible to collect customs
duties on imports landed at the planters&#8217; own wharves
along hundreds of miles of inland waterways. The
royal governors and responsible persons in the
Assembly reacted therefore with a succession of
plans to establish towns that would be the sole
ports of entry for the areas they served, thus making
theoretically simple the task of securing customs
revenues. The towns also would be centers of business
and manufacture, diversifying the colony&#8217;s
economic supports and lessening its dependence on
tobacco. To men of English origin this establishment
of port communities must have seemed natural and
logical.</p>

<p>The first such proposal became law in 1662,
establishing a port town for each of the major river
valleys and for the Eastern Shore. But the law&#8217;s
sponsors were doomed to disappointment, for the
towns were not built.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> After a considerable lapse,
a new act was passed in 1680, this one better implemented
and further reaching. It provided for a port
town in each county, where ships were to deliver
their goods and pick up tobacco and other exports
from town warehouses for their return voyages.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
One of its most influential supporters was William
Fitzhugh of Stafford County, a wealthy planter and
distinguished leader in the colony.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> &#8220;We have now
resolved a cessation of making Tob<sup>o</sup> next year,&#8221;
he wrote to his London agent, Captain Partis, in
1680. &#8220;We are also going to make Towns, if you
can meet with any tradesmen that will come and live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a><br /><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
at the Town, they may have privileges and immunitys.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

Theodorick Bland&#8217;s, 1691. (The courthouse probably
stood in the vicinity of lot 21.)</span>
</div>

<p>Some of these towns actually were laid out, each on
a 50-acre tract of half-acre lots, but only 9 tracts were
built upon. The Act soon lagged and collapsed. It
was unpopular with the colonists, who were obliged
to transport their tobacco to distant warehouses and
to pay storage fees; it was ignored by shipmasters,
who were in the habit of dealing directly with planters
at their wharves and who were not interested in
making it any easier for His Majesty&#8217;s customs
collectors.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, efforts to come up with a third act
began in 1688.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> William Fitzhugh, especially, was
articulate in his alarm over Virginia&#8217;s one-crop
economy, the effects of which the towns were supposed
to mitigate. At this time he referred to tobacco
as &#8220;our most despicable commodity.&#8221; A year later,
he remarked, &#8220;it is more uncertain for a Planter to
get money by consigned Tob<sup>o</sup> then to get a prize in a
lottery, there being twenty chances for one chance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In April 1691 the Act for Ports was passed, the
House, significantly, recording only one dissenting
vote.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Unlike its predecessor, which encouraged
trades and crafts, this Act was justified purely on the
basis of overcoming the &#8220;great opportunity ... given
to such as attempt to import or export goods and
merchandises, without entering or paying the duties
and customs due thereupon, much practised by
greedy and covetous persons.&#8221; It provided that all
exports and imports should be taken up or set down
at the specified ports and nowhere else, under penalty
of forfeiting ship, gear, and cargo, and that the law
should become effective October 1, 1692. The towns
again were to be surveyed and laid out in 50-acre
tracts. Feoffees, to be appointed, would grant half-acre
lots on a pro rata first-cost basis. Grantees
&#8220;shall within the space of four months next ensueing
such grant begin and without delay proceed to build
and finish on each half acre one good house, to containe
twenty foot square at the least, wherein if he
fails to performe them such grant to be void in law,
and the lands therein granted lyable to the choyce
and purchase of any other person.&#8221; Justices of the
county courts were to fill vacancies among the feoffees
and to appoint customs collectors.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>


<p class="title">THE PORT TOWN FOR STAFFORD COUNTY</p>

<p>The difficulties confronting the central and local
governing bodies in putting the Acts into effect are
illustrated by the attempts to establish a port town
for Stafford County. Under the act of 1680 a town
was to be built at &#8220;Peace Point,&#8221; where the Catholic
refugee Giles Brent had settled nearly forty years
before, but there is no evidence that even so much
as a survey was made there. The 1691 Act for
Ports located the town at Potomac Neck, where
Accokeek Creek and Potomac Creek converge on the
Potomac River. Situated about three miles below
the previously designated site, it was again on Brent
property, lying within a tract leased for life to Captain
Malachi Peale, former high sheriff of Stafford. On
October 9, 1691, the Stafford Court &#8220;ordered that
Mr. William Buckner deputy Surveyor of this County
shall on Thursday next ... repair to the Malachy
Peale neck being the place allotted by act of assembly
for this Town and Port of this County and shall then
and there Survey and Lay Out the said Towne or
Port ... to the Interest that all the gentlemen of
and all other of the Inhabitants may take up such
Lot and Lots as be and they desire....&#8221; On the
same day John Withers and Matthew Thompson,
both justices of the peace, were appointed &#8220;Feoffees
in Trust.&#8221; Young Giles Brent, &#8220;son and heir of
Giles Brent Gent. late of this county dec<sup>ed</sup>&#8221; and not
yet 21, selected Francis Hammersley as his guardian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Hammersley in this capacity became the administrator
of Brent&#8217;s affairs, and accordingly it was agreed
that 13,000 pounds of tobacco should be paid to him
in exchange for the 50 acres of town land owned by
Brent.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Actually, 52 acres were surveyed, &#8220;two of the said
acres being the Land belonging to and laid out for
the Court House according to a former Act of Assembly
and the other fifty acres pursuant to the late
Act for Ports.&#8221; The &#8220;former Act of Assembly&#8221;
which had been passed in 1667 had stipulated the
allotment of two-acre tracts for churches and court houses,
which in case the lots &#8220;be deserted y<sup>e</sup> land
shall revert to y<sup>e</sup> 1st proprietor....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> For the
extra two acres Hammersley was given 800 pounds of
tobacco in addition. Of the total of 13,800 pounds,
3450 were set aside to compensate Malachi Peale for
the loss of his leasehold.</p>

<p>The order for the survey to be made was a formality,
since the plat had actually been drawn ahead of
time by Buckner on August 16, nearly two months
before; clearly the Staffordians were eager to begin
their town. Buckner&#8217;s plat was copied by his superior,
Theodorick Bland, and entered in the now-missing
Stafford Survey Book. John Savage, a later surveyor,
in 1731 provided John Mercer with a duplicate
of Bland&#8217;s copy, which has survived in John Mercer&#8217;s
Land Book (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>).<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On February 11, 1692, the feoffees granted 27 lots
to 15 applicants. John Mercer&#8217;s later review of the
town&#8217;s history in this period states that &#8220;many&#8221; of the
lots were &#8220;built on and improved.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Two ordinaries
were licensed, one in 1691 and one in 1693, but no
business activity other than the Potomac Creek ferry
seems to have been conducted.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Any future the
town might have had was erased by the same adverse
reactions that had killed the previous port acts. The
merchants and shippers used their negative influence
and on March 22, 1693, a &#8220;bill for suspension of
y<sup>e</sup> act for Ports &amp;c. till their Maj<sup>ts</sup> pleasure shall be
known therein or till y<sup>e</sup> next assembly&#8221; passed the
house. In due course the act was reviewed and returned
unsigned for further consideration. William
Fitzhugh, on October 17, 1693, dutifully read the
recommendation of the Committee of Grievances and
Properties &#8220;That the appointment of Ports &amp; injoyneing
the Landing and Shipping of all goods
imported or to be exported at &amp; from the same will
(considering the present circumstances of the Country)
be very injurious &amp; burthensome to the Inhabitants
thereof and traders thereunto.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Doubtless dictated
by the Board of Trade in London, the recommendation
was a defeat for those who, like Fitzhugh, sought by
the establishment of towns to break tobacco&#8217;s strangle-hold
on Virginia.</p>


<p class="title">THE ACT FOR PORTS OF 1705
AND THE NAMING OF MARLBOROUGH</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the town idea was hard to kill.
In 1705 Stafford&#8217;s port town, along with those in
the other counties, was given a new lease on life
when still another Act for Ports, introduced by
Robert Beverley, was passed. This Act repeated
in substance the provisions of its immediate forerunner,
but provided in addition extravagant inducements
to settlement. Those who inhabited
the towns were exempted from three-quarters of the
customs duties paid by others; they were freed of
poll taxes for 15 years; they were relieved from military
mustering outside the towns and from marching
outside, excepting the &#8220;exigency&#8221; of war (and then
only for a distance of no more than 50 miles). Goods
and &#8220;dead provision&#8221; were not to be sold outside
within a 5-mile radius, and ordinaries (other than
those within the towns) were not permitted closer
than 10 miles to the towns&#8217; boundaries, except at
courthouses and ferry landings. Each town was to
be a free &#8220;burgh,&#8221; and, when it had grown to 30
families &#8220;besides ordinary keepers,&#8221; &#8220;eight principal
inhabitants&#8221; were to be chosen by vote of the &#8220;freeholders
and inhabitants of the town of twenty-one
years of age and upwards, not being servants or
apprentices,&#8221; to be called &#8220;benchers of the guild-hall.&#8221;
These eight &#8220;benchers&#8221; would govern the
town for life or until removal, selecting a &#8220;director&#8221;
from among themselves. When 60 families had
settled, &#8220;brethren assistants of the guild hall&#8221; were
to be elected similarly to serve as a common council.
Each town was to have two market days a week and
an annual five-day fair. The towns listed under
the Act were virtually the same as before, but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
time each was given an official name, the hitherto
anonymous town for Stafford being called Marlborough
in honor of the hero of the recent victory
at Blenheim.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The elaborate vision of the Act&#8217;s sponsors never
was realized in the newly christened town, but there
was in due course a slight resumption of activity in
it. George Mason and William Fitzhugh, Jr. (the
son of William Fitzhugh of Stafford County) were
appointed feoffees in 1707, and a new survey was
made by Thomas Gregg. The following year seven
more lots were granted, and for an interval of two
years Marlborough functioned technically as an
official port.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Inevitably, perhaps, history repeated itself. In 1710
the Act for Ports, like its predecessors, was rescinded.
The reasons given in London were brief and straightforward;
the Act, it was explained, was &#8220;designed to
Encourage by great Priviledges the settling in Townships.&#8221;
These settlements would encourage manufactures,
which, in turn, would promote &#8220;further
Improvement of the said manufactures, And take
them off from the Planting of Tobacco, which would
be of Very Ill consequence,&#8221; thus lessening the
colony&#8217;s dependence on the Kingdom, affecting the
import of tobacco, and prejudicing shipping.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Clearly, the Crown did not want the towns to succeed,
nor would it tolerate anything which might stimulate
colonial self-dependence. The Virginia colonists&#8217;
dream of corporate communities was not to be
realized.</p>

<p>Most of the towns either died entirely or struggled
on as crossroads villages. A meager few have survived
to the present, notably Norfolk, Hampton,
Yorktown, and Tappahannock. Marlborough lasted
as a town until about 1720, but in about 1718 the
courthouse and several dwellings were destroyed by
fire and &#8220;A new Court House being built at another
Place, all or most of the Houses that had been built
in the said Town, were either burnt or suffered to go
to ruin.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The towns were artificial entities, created by acts
of assembly, not by economic or social necessity.
In the few places where they filled a need, notably
in the populous areas of the lower James and York
Rivers, they flourished without regard to official
status. In other places, by contrast, no law or edict
sufficed to make them live when conditions did not
warrant them. In sparsely settled Stafford especially
there was little to nurture a town. It was easier, and
perhaps more exciting, to grow tobacco and gamble
on a successful crop, to go in debt when things were
bad or lend to the less fortunate when things were
better. In the latter case land became an acceptable
medium for the payment of debts. Land was wealth
and power, its enlargement the means of greater
production of tobacco&mdash;tobacco again the great
gamble by which one would always hope to rise and
not to fall. When one could own an empire, why
should one worry about a town?</p>


<p class="title">ESTABLISHING COURTHOUSES</p>

<p>The administrative problems that contributed to
the establishment of the port towns also called for the
erection of courthouses. As early as 1624 lower courts
had been authorized for Charles City and Elizabeth
City in recognition of the colony&#8217;s expansion, and ten
years later the colony had been divided into eight
counties, with a monthly court established in each.
By the Restoration the county courts possessed broadly
expanded powers and were the administrative as well
as the judicial sources of local government. In practice
they were largely self-appointive and were responsible
for filling most local offices. Since the courts
were the vehicles of royal authority, it followed that
the physical symbols of this authority should be
emphasized by building proper houses of government.
At Jamestown orders were given in 1663 to build a
statehouse in lieu of the alehouses and ordinaries
where laws had been made previously.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In the same year, four courthouses annually were
ordered for the counties, the burgesses having been
empowered to &#8220;make and Signe agreements w<sup>th</sup> any
that will undertake them to build, who are to give
good Caution for the effecting thereof with good
sufficient bricks, Lime, and Timber, and that the
same be well wrought and after they are finished to
be approved by an able surveyor, before order be
given them for their pay.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Such buildings were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>take the place of private dwellings and ordinaries in
the same way as did the statehouse at Jamestown.
It was no accident that legislation for houses of
government coincided with that for establishing port
towns. Each reflected the need for administering the
far-flung reaches of the colony and for maintaining
order and respect for the crown in remote places.</p>


<p class="title">THE COURTHOUSE IN THE PORT TOWN
FOR STAFFORD COUNTY</p>

<p>Stafford County, which had been set off from
Westmoreland in 1664, was provided with a courthouse
within a year of its establishment. Ralph
Happel in <i>Stafford and King George Courthouses and the
Fate of Marlborough, Port of Entry</i>, has given us a
detailed chronicle of the Stafford courthouses, showing
that the first structure was situated south of
Potomac Creek until 1690, when it presumably
burned.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The court, in any event, began to meet
in a private house on November 12, 1690, while on
November 14 one Sampson Darrell was appointed
chief undertaker and Ambrose Bayley builder of a
new courthouse. A contract was signed between them
and the justices of the court to finish the building by
June 10, 1692, at a cost of 40,000 pounds of tobacco
and cash, half to be paid in 1691 and the remainder
upon completion.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>With William Fitzhugh the presiding magistrate
of the Stafford County court as well as cosponsor of
the Act for Ports, it was foreordained that the new
courthouse should be tied in with plans for the port
town. The Act for Ports, however, was still in the
making, and it was not possible to begin the courthouse
until after its passage in the spring. On
June 10, 1691, it was &#8220;Ordered by this Court that
Capt. George Mason and Mr. Blande the Surveyor
shall immediately goe and run over the ground where
the Town is to Stand and that they shall then advise
and direct M<sup>r</sup> Samson Darrell the Cheife undertaker
of the Court house for this County where he shall
Erect and build the same.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The court&#8217;s order was followed by a hectic sequence
that reflects, in general, the irresponsibilities, the
lack of respect for law and order, and the frontier
weaknesses which made it necessary to strengthen
authority. It begins with Sampson Darrell himself,
whose moral shortcomings seem to have been legion
(hog-stealing, cheating a widow, and refusing to give
indentured servants their freedom after they had
earned it, to name a few). Darrell undoubtedly
had the fastidious Fitzhugh&#8217;s confidence, for certainly
without that he would not have been appointed
undertaker at all. In his position in the court,
Fitzhugh would have been instrumental in selecting
both architect and architecture for the courthouse,
and Darrell seems to have met his requirements.
Fitzhugh, in fact, had sufficient confidence in Darrell
to entrust him with personal business in London in
1688.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Although several months elapsed before a site was
chosen, enough of the new building was erected by
October to shelter the court for its monthly assembly.
In the course of this session, there occurred a &#8220;most
mischievous and dangerous Riot,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which rather
violently inaugurated the new building. During this
disturbance, the pastor of Potomac Parish, Parson
John Waugh,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> upbraided the court while it was
&#8220;seated&#8221; and took occasion to call Fitzhugh a Papist.
The court, taking cognizance of &#8220;disorders, misrules
and Riots&#8221; and &#8220;the Fatal consequences of such
unhappy malignant and Tumultuous proceeding,&#8221;
thereupon restricted the sale of liquor on court days
(thus revealing what was at least accessory to the
disturbance).<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Fitzhugh&#8217;s letter to the court concerning
this episode mentions the &#8220;Court House&#8221; and
the &#8220;Court house yard,&#8221; adding to Happel&#8217;s ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
documentation that the new building was by now in
use.</p>

<p>During the November session, James Mussen was
ordered into custody for having &#8220;dangerously wounded
M<sup>r</sup>. Sampson Darrell.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This suggests that the
sequence of disturbances may have been associated
with the unfinished state of the courthouse, which,
like the town, symbolized the purposes of Fitzhugh
and the property-owning aristocracy. Certain it is
that Darrell, publicly identified with Fitzhugh, was
violently assaulted and that &#8220;a complaint was made
to this Court that Sampson Darrell the chief undertaker
of the building and Erecting of a Court house for
this county had not performed the same according to
articles of agreement.&#8221; He and Bayley accordingly
were put under bond to finish the building by June
10, 1692. By February Bayley was complaining that
he had not been paid for his work, &#8220;notwithstanding
your pet<sup>r</sup> as is well known to the whole County hath
done all the carpenters work thereof and is ready to
perform what is yet wanting.&#8221; On May 12, less than
a month from the deadline for completion, Darrell
was ordered to pay Bayley the money owing, and
Bayley was instructed to go on with the work. Nearly
six months later, on November 10, Darrell again was
directed to pay Bayley the full balance of his wages,
but only &#8220;after the said Ambrose Bayley shall have
finished and Compleatly ended the Court house.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>No description of the courthouse has been found.
The Act of 1663 seems to have required a brick
building, although its wording is ambiguous. Even
if it did stipulate brick, the law was 28 years old in
1691, and its requirements probably were ignored.
Although Bayley, the builder, was a carpenter, this
would not preclude the possibility that he supervised
bricklayers and other artisans. Brick courthouses
were not unknown; one was standing in Warwick
when the Act for Ports was passed in 1691. Yet, the
York courthouse, built in 1692, was a simple building,
probably of wood.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In any case, the Stafford courthouse
was a structure large enough to have required
more than a year and a half to build, but not so
elaborate as to have cost more than 40,000 pounds
of tobacco.</p>


<p class="title">LOCATION OF THE STAFFORD COURTHOUSE</p>

<p>The location of the building is indicated by a
notation on Buckner&#8217;s plat of the port town: &#8220;The
fourth course (runs) down along by the Gutt between
Geo: Andrew&#8217;s &amp; the Court house to Potomack
Creek.&#8221; A glance at the plat (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>) will disclose
that the longitudinal boundaries of all the lots south
of a line between George Andrews&#8217; &#8220;Gutt&#8221; run
parallel to this fourth course. Plainly, the courthouse
was situated near the head of the gutt, where the
westerly boundary course changed, near the end of
&#8220;The Broad Street Across the Town.&#8221; It may be
significant that the foundation (Structure B) on
which John Mercer&#8217;s mansion was later built is
located in this vicinity.</p>

<p>In or about the year 1718 the courthouse &#8220;burnt
Down,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> while it was reported as &#8220;being become
ruinous&#8221; in 1720, with its &#8220;Situation very inconvenient
for the greater part of the Inhabitants.&#8221; It was
then agreed to build a new courthouse &#8220;at the head
of Ocqua Creek.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Aquia Creek was probably
meant, but this must have been an error and the &#8220;head
of Potomac Creek&#8221; intended instead. Happel shows
that it was built on the south side of Potomac Creek.
Thus, the burning of the Marlborough courthouse
in 1718 merely speeded up the forces that led to the
end of the town&#8217;s career.</p>


<p class="title">MARLBOROUGH PROPERTY OWNERS</p>

<p>Not only was Marlborough foredoomed by external
decrees and adverse official decisions, but much of its
failure was rooted in the local elements by which
it was constituted. The great majority of lot holders
were the &#8220;gentlemen&#8221; who were so carefully distinguished
from &#8220;all other of the Inhabitants&#8221; in the
order to survey the town in 1691. Most were leading
personages in Stafford, and we may assume that their
purchases of lots were made in the interests of investment
gains, not in establishing homes or businesses.
Only three or four yeomen and ordinary keepers seem
to have settled in the town.</p>

<p>Sampson Darrell, for example, held two lots, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
lived at Aquia Creek.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Francis Hammersley was a
planter who married Giles Brent&#8217;s widow and lived
at &#8220;The Retirement,&#8221; one of the Brent estates.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
George Brent, nephew of the original Giles Brent, was
law partner of William Fitzhugh, and had been
appointed Receiver General of the Northern Neck in
1690. His brother Robert also was a lot holder.
Both lived at Woodstock, and presumably they did
not maintain residences at the port town.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Other
leading citizens were Robert Alexander, Samuel Hayward,
and Martin Scarlett, but again there is little
likelihood that they were ever residents of the town.
John Waugh, the uproarious pastor of Potomac
Parish, also was a lot holder, but he lived on the south
side of Potomac Creek in a house which belonged to
Mrs. Anne Meese of London. His failure to pay for
that house after 11 years&#8217; occupancy of it, which led
to a suit in which Fitzhugh was the prosecutor, does
not suggest that he ever arrived at building a house
in the port town.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Captain George Mason was a distinguished individual
who lived at &#8220;Accokeek,&#8221; about a mile and
a half from Marlborough. He certainly built in the
town, for in 1691 he petitioned for a license to &#8220;keep
an ordinary at the Town or Port for this county.&#8221;
The petition was granted on condition that he &#8220;find
a good and Sufficient maintenance and reception
both for man and horse.&#8221; Captain Mason was
grandfather of George Mason of Gunston Hall,
author of the Virginia Bill of Rights, and was, at one
time or another, sheriff, lieutenant colonel and
commander in chief of the Stafford Rangers, and a
burgess. He participated in putting down the uprising
of Nanticoke Indians in 1692, bringing in
captives for trial at the unfinished courthouse in
March of that year.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Despite his interest in the
town, however, it is unlikely that he ever lived there.</p>

<p>Another lot owner was Captain Malachi Peale,
whose lease of the town land from the Brents had
been purchased when the site was selected. He also
was an important figure, having been sheriff. He
may well have lived on one of his three lots, since
he was a resident of the Neck to begin with. John
Withers, one of the first feoffees and a justice of the
peace, was a lot holder also. George Andrews and
Peter Beach, somewhat less distinguished, were perhaps
the only full-time residents from among the
first grantees. After 1708 Thomas Ballard and
possibly William Barber were also householders.</p>

<p>Thus, few of the ingredients of an active community
were to be found at Marlborough, the skilled craftsmen
or ship&#8217;s chandlers or merchants who might
have provided the vitality of commerce and trade
not having at any time been present.</p>


<p class="title">HOUSING</p>

<p>It is likely that most of the houses in the town conformed
to the minimum requirements of 20 by 20
feet. They were probably all of wood, a story and a
half high with a chimney built against one end.
Forman describes a 20-foot-square house foundation
at Jamestown, known as the &#8220;House on Isaac Watson&#8217;s
Land.&#8221; This had a brick floor and a fireplace large
enough to take an 8-foot log as well as a setting for a
brew copper. The ground floor consisted of one room,
and there was probably a loft overhead providing
extra sleeping and storage space.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The original
portion of the Digges house at Yorktown, built following
the Port Act of 1705 and still standing, is a brick
house, also 20 feet square and a story and a half high.
Yet, brick houses certainly were not the rule. In
remote Stafford County, shortly before the port town
was built, the houses of even well-placed individuals
were sometimes extremely primitive. William Fitzhugh
wrote in 1687 to his lawyer and merchant
friend Nicholas Hayward in London, &#8220;Your brother
Joseph&#8217;s building that Shell, of a house without
Chimney or partition, &amp; not one tittle of workmanship
about it more than a Tobacco house work,
carry&#8217;d him into those Arrears with your self &amp; his
other Employees, as you found by his Accots. at his
death.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Ancient English puncheon-type construction,
with studs and posts set three feet into the
ground, was still in use at Marlborough in 1691, as
we know from the contract for building a prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
quoted by Happel.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> No doubt the houses there
varied in quality, but we may be sure that most were
crude, inexpertly built, of frame or puncheon-type
construction, and subject to deterioration by rot and
insects.</p>


<p class="title">FURNISHINGS OF TWO MARLBOROUGH HOUSES</p>

<p>Like George Mason, George Andrews ran an ordinary
at the port town, having been licensed in 1693,
and he also kept the ferry across Potomac Creek.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
He died in 1698, leaving the property to his grandson
John Cave. From the inventory of his estate recorded
in the Stafford County records (<a href="#Page_183">Appendix A</a>) we
obtain a picture not only of the furnishings of a house
in the port town, but also of what constituted an
ordinary.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> We are left with no doubt that as a
hostelry Andrews&#8217; house left much to be desired.
There were no bedsteads, although six small feather
beds with bolsters and one old and small flock bed
are listed. (Flock consisted of tufted and fragmentary
pieces of wool and cotton, while &#8220;Bed&#8221; referred not
to a bedframe or bedstead but to the tick or mattress.)
There were two pairs of curtains and valances.
In the 17th century a valance was &#8220;A border of
drapery hanging around the canopy of a bed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Curtains customarily were suspended from within
the valance from bone or brass curtain rings on a
rod or wire, and were drawn around the bed for
privacy or warmth. Where high post bedsteads
were used, the curtains and valances were supported
on the rectangular frame of the canopy or tester.
Since George Andrews did not list any bedsteads, it
is possible that his curtains and valances were hung
from bracketed frames above low wooden frames that
held the bedding. Six of his beds were covered with
&#8220;rugs,&#8221; one of which was &#8220;Turkey work.&#8221; There
is no indication of sheets or other refinements for
sleeping.</p>

<p>Andrews&#8217; furniture was old, but apparently of good
quality. Four &#8220;old&#8221; cane chairs, which may have
dated back as far as 1660, were probably English,
of carved walnut. The &#8220;old&#8221; table may have had
a turned or a joined frame, or possibly may have
been a homemade trestle table. An elegant touch
was the &#8220;carpet,&#8221; which undoubtedly covered it.
Chests of drawers were rare in the 17th century, so
it is surprising to find one described here as &#8220;old.&#8221;
A &#8220;cupboard&#8221; was probably a press or court cupboard
for the display of plates and dishes and perhaps the
pair of &#8220;Tankards&#8221; listed in the inventory. The
latter may have been pewter or German stoneware
with pewter mounts. The &#8220;couch&#8221; was a combination
bed and settee. As in every house there were
chests, but of what sort or quality we can only
surmise. A &#8220;great trunk&#8221; provided storage.</p>

<p>Andrews&#8217; hospitality as host is symbolized by his
<i>lignum vitae</i> punchbowl. Punch itself was something
of an innovation and had first made its appearance in
England aboard ships arriving from India early in
the 1600&#8217;s. It remained a sailor&#8217;s drink throughout
most of the century, but had begun to gain in general
popularity before 1700 in the colonies. What is more
remarkable here, however, is the container. Edward
M. Pinto states that such <i>lignum vitae</i> &#8220;wassail&#8221; bowls
were sometimes large enough to hold five gallons of
punch and were kept in one place on the table, where
all present took part in the mixing. They were lathe-turned
and usually stood on pedestals.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> George
Andrews&#8217; nutmeg graters, silver spoons, and silver
dram cup for tasting the spirits that were poured into
the punch were all elegant accessories.</p>

<p>Another resident whose estate was inventoried was
Peter Beach.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> One of his executors was Daniel
Beach, who was paid 300 pounds of tobacco annually
from 1700 to 1703 for &#8220;sweeping&#8221; and &#8220;cleaning&#8221; the
courthouse (<a href="#Page_184">Appendix B</a>). Beach&#8217;s furnishings were
scarcely more elaborate than Andrews&#8217;. Unlike
Andrews, he owned four bedsteads, which with their
curtains and fittings (here called &#8220;furniture&#8221;) varied
in worth from 100 to 1500 pounds of tobacco. Here
again was a cupboard, while there were nine chairs
with &#8220;flag&#8221; seats and &#8220;boarded&#8221; backs (rush-seated
chairs, probably of the &#8220;slat-back&#8221; or &#8220;ladder-back&#8221;
variety). Eight more chairs and five stools were not
described. A &#8220;parcel of old tables&#8221; was listed, but
only one table appears to have been in use. There
were pewter and earthenware, but a relatively few
cooking utensils. An &#8220;old&#8221; pewter tankard was
probably the most elegant drinking vessel, while one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
candlestick was a grudging concession to the need for
artificial light. The only books were two Bibles;
the list mentions a single indentured servant.</p>


<p class="title">THE GREGG SURVEY</p>

<p>In 1707, after the revival of the Port Act, the new
county surveyor, Thomas Gregg, made another survey
of the town. This was done apparently without regard
to Buckner&#8217;s original survey. Since Gregg adopted
an entirely new system of numbering, and since his
survey was lost at an early date, it is impossible to
locate by their description the sites of the lots granted
in 1708 and after.</p>

<p>Forty years later John Mercer wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is certain that Thomas Gregg (being the Surveyor
of Stafford County) did Sep 2<sup>d</sup> 1707 make a new Survey
of the Town.... it is as certain that Gregg had no
regard either to the bounds or numbers of the former
Survey since he begins his Numbers the reverse way
making his number 1 in the corner at Buckner&#8217;s 19 &amp;
as his Survey is not to be found its impossible to tell
how he continued his Numbers. No scheme I have
tried will answer, &amp; the Records differ as much, the
streets according to Buckner&#8217;s Survey running thro the
House I lived in built by Ballard tho his whole lot was
ditched in according to the Bounds made by Gregg.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever the intent may have been in laying out
formal street and lot plans, Marlborough was essentially
a rustic village. If Gregg&#8217;s plat ran streets
through the positions of houses on the Buckner
survey, and vice versa, it is clear that not much
attention was paid to theoretical property lines or
streets. Ballard apparently dug a boundary ditch
around his lot, according to Virginia practice in the
17th century, but the fact that this must have encroached
on property assigned to somebody else on
the basis of the Buckner survey seems not to have
been noted at the time. Rude houses placed informally
and connected by lanes and footpaths, the
courthouse attempting to dominate them like a
village schoolmaster in a class of country bumpkins,
a few outbuildings, a boat landing or two, some
cultivated land, and a road leading away from the
courthouse to the north with another running in the
opposite direction to the creek&mdash;this is the way
Marlborough must have looked even in its best days
in 1708.</p>


<p class="title">THE DEATH OF MARLBOROUGH AS A TOWN</p>

<p>Could this poor village have survived had the
courthouse not burned? It was an unhappy contrast
to the vision of a town governed by &#8220;benchers of the
guild hall,&#8221; bustling with mercantile activity, swarming
on busy market days with ordinaries filled with
people. This fantasy may have pulsated briefly
through the minds of a few. But, after the abrogation
of the Port Act in 1710, there was little left to justify
the town&#8217;s existence other than the courthouse. So
long as court kept, there was need for ordinaries and
ferries and for independent jacks-of-all-trades like
Andrews. But with neither courthouse nor port
activity nor manufacture, the town became a paradox
in an economy and society of planters.</p>

<p>Remote and inaccessible, uninhabited by individuals
whose skills could have given it vigor, Marlborough
no longer had any reason for being. It lingered on
for a short time, but when John Mercer came to
transform the abandoned village into a flourishing
plantation, &#8220;Most of the other Buildings were suffered
to go to Ruin, so that in the year 1726, when your
Petitioner [i.e., Mercer] went to live there, but one
House twenty-feet square was standing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

were reflected at this time in hysterical rumors that the Roman
Catholics of Maryland were plotting to stir up the Indians
against Virginia. In Stafford County these suspicions were
inflamed by the harangues of Parson John Waugh, minister
of Stafford Parish church and Chotank church. Waugh, who
seems to have been a rabble rouser, appealed to the same small
landholders and malcontents as those who, a generation
earlier, had followed Nathaniel Bacon&#8217;s leadership. So seriously
did the authorities at Jamestown regard the disturbance
at Stafford courthouse that they sent three councillors to
investigate. See &#8220;Notes,&#8221; <i>William &amp; Mary College Quarterly

<br />
<i>John Mercer&#8217;s Occupation
of Marlborough, 1726-1730</i></h3>


<p class="title">MERCER&#8217;S ARRIVAL IN STAFFORD COUNTY</p>

<p>By 1723 Marlborough lay abandoned. George
Mason (III), son of the late sheriff and ordinary keeper
in the port town, held the now-empty title of feoffee,
together with Rice Hooe. In that year Mason and
Hooe petitioned the General Court &#8220;that Leave may
be given to bring in a Bill to enable them to sell the
said Land [of the town] the same not being built
upon or Inhabited.&#8221; The petition was put aside for
&#8220;consideration,&#8221; but within a week&mdash;on May 21,
1723&mdash;it was &#8220;ordered That Rice Hooe &amp; George
Mason be at liberty to withdraw their petition ...
and that the Committee to whom it was referred be
discharged from proceeding thereon.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>This curious sequence remains unexplained. Had
the committee informally advised the feoffees that
their cause would be rejected, suggesting, therefore,
that they withdraw their petition? Or had something
unexpected occurred to provide an alternative
solution to the problem of Marlborough?</p>

<p>Possibly it was the latter, and the unexpected occurrence
may have been the arrival in Stafford County
of young John Mercer. There is no direct evidence
that Mercer was in the vicinity as early as 1723; but
we know that he appeared before 1725, that he had
by then become well acquainted with George Mason,
and that he settled in Marlborough in 1726.</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s remarkable career began with his arrival
in Virginia at the age of 16. Born in Dublin in 1704,
the son of a Church Street merchant of English
descent&mdash;also named John Mercer&mdash;and of Grace
Fenton Mercer, John was educated at Trinity
College, and then sailed for the New World in 1720.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
How Mercer arrived in Virginia or what means he
brought with him are lost to the record. From his
own words written toward the end of his life we
know that he was not overburdened with wealth:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Except my education I never got a shilling of my
fathers or any other relations estate, every penny I ever
got has been by my own industry &amp; with as much fatigue
as most people have undergone.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From his second ledger (the first, covering the
years 1720-1724, having been lost) we learn that he
was engaged in miscellaneous trading, sailing up and
down the rivers in his sloop and exchanging goods
along the way. Where his home was in these early
years we do not know, but it would appear that he
had been active in the Stafford County region for
some time, judging from the fact that by 1725 he had
accumulated £322 4s. 5&frac12;d. worth of tobacco in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
warehouse at the falls of the Rappahannock.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> He
certainly had encountered George Mason before
then, and probably Mason&#8217;s uncles, John, David, and
James Waugh, the sons of Parson John Waugh, all
of whom owned idle Marlborough properties.</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s friendship with the Masons was sufficiently
well established by 1725 that on June 10 of that year
he married George&#8217;s sister Catherine. This marriage,
most advantageous to an aspiring young man,
was celebrated at Mrs. Ann Fitzhugh&#8217;s in King George
County with the Reverend Alexander Scott of
Overwharton Parish in Stafford County officiating.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Thus, allied to an established family that was &#8220;old&#8221;
by standards of the time and sponsored socially by a
representative of the Fitzhughs, Mercer was admitted
at the age of 21 to Virginia&#8217;s growing aristocracy.</p>

<p>In this animated and energetic youth, the Masons
and Waughs probably saw the means of bringing
Marlborough back to life. Mercer, for his part, no
doubt recognized the advantages that Marlborough
offered, with its sheltered harbor and landing, its
fertile, flat fields, and airy situation. That it could
be acquired piecemeal at a minimum of investment
through the provisions of the Act for Ports was an
added inducement.</p>

B. Payne.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>During 1725 Mercer pressed ahead with his trading
enterprises. From his ledger we learn that he sold
Richard Ambler of Yorktown 710 pounds of &#8220;raw
Deerskins&#8221; for £35 10s. and bought £200 worth of
&#8220;sundry goods&#8221; from him. Between October 1725
and February 1726 he sold a variety of furnishings
and equipment to Richard Johnson, ranging from a
&#8220;horsewhip&#8221; and a &#8220;silk Rugg&#8221; to &#8220;&frac12; doz. Shoemaker&#8217;s
knives&#8221; and an &#8220;Ivory Comb.&#8221; In return
he received two hogsheads of tobacco, &#8220;a Gallon of
syder Laceground,&#8221; and raw and dressed deerskins.
He maintained a similar long account with Mosley
Battaley (Battaille) (<a href="#Page_185">Appendix C</a>). From William
Rogers of Yorktown<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> he bought £12 3s. 6d. worth
of earthenware, presumably for resale. The tobacco
which he had accumulated at the falls of the Rappahannock
he sold for cash to the Gloucester firm of
Whiting &amp; Montague, paying Peter Kemp two
pounds &#8220;for the extraordinary trouble of y<sup>r</sup> coming
up so far for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His sloop was the principal means by which Mercer
conducted his business. Occasionally he rented it
for hire, once sharing the proceeds of a load of oystershells
with George Mason and one Edgeley, who had
sailed the sloop to obtain the shells. Only one item
shows that Mercer extended his mercantile activities
to slaves: on February 18, 1726, he sold a mulatto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
woman named Sarah to Philemon Cavanaugh &#8220;to be
paid in heavy tobacco each hhd to weigh 300 Neat.&#8221;</p>

<p>That Mercer was turning in the direction of a legal
career is revealed in his first account of &#8220;Domestick
Expenses&#8221; for the fall of 1725 (<a href="#Page_186">Appendix D</a>). We find
that he was attending court sessions far and wide:
&#8220;Cash for Exp<sup>s</sup> at Stafford &amp; Spotsylvania,&#8221; &#8220;Cash
for Exp<sup>s</sup> Urbanna,&#8221; the same for &#8220;Court Ferrage
at Keys.&#8221; He already was reading in the law, and
lent &#8220;March&#8217;s Actions of Slander,&#8221; &#8220;Washington&#8217;s
Abridgm<sup>t</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> Statutes,&#8221; and &#8220;an Exposition of the
Law Terms&#8221; to Mosley Battaley.</p>


<p class="title">SETTING UP HOUSEKEEPING</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s domestic-expense account is full of evidence
that he was preparing to set up housekeeping.
He bought &#8220;1 China punch bowl,&#8221; 10s.; &#8220;6 glasses,&#8221;
3s.; &#8220;1 box Iron &amp; heaters,&#8221; 2s. 6d.; &#8220;1 p<sup>r</sup> fine
blankets,&#8221; 1s. 13d.; &#8220;Earthen ware,&#8221; 10s.; &#8220;5 Candlesticks,&#8221;
17s. 6d.; &#8220;1 Bed Cord,&#8221; 2s.; &#8220;3 maple knives
&amp; forks,&#8221; 2s.; &#8220;1 yew haft knife &amp; fork &amp; 1 p<sup>r</sup> Stilds
[steelyards?],&#8221; 1s. 10&frac12;d.; &#8220;1 p<sup>r</sup> Salisbury Scissors,&#8221;
2s. 6d.; and &#8220;1 speckled knife &amp; fork,&#8221; 5d.</p>

<p>In addition, he accepted as payment for various
cloth and materials sold to Mrs. Elizabeth Russell the
following furniture and furnishings:</p>

<p>At the time of this purchase, the only house standing
at Marlborough was that built by Thomas Ballard
in 1708. It was inherited by his godson David
Waugh,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> who now apparently offered to let his
niece Catherine and her new husband occupy it.
Mercer later referred to it as &#8220;the House I lived in
built by Ballard.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> From his own records we know
that he moved to Marlborough in 1726. He did
so probably in the summer, since on June 11 he
settled with Charles McClelland for &#8220;cleaning out
y<sup>e</sup> house.&#8221; Unoccupied for years and small in size,
it was a humble place in which to set up housekeeping,
and indeed must have needed &#8220;cleaning out.&#8221; It
also must have needed extensive repairs, since Mercer
purchased 1500 tenpenny nails &#8220;used about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout 1726 Mercer acquired household
furnishings, made repairs and improvements, and
obtained the necessities of a plantation. On February
1 he acquired &#8220;3 Ironbacks&#8221; (cast-iron firebacks for
fireplaces) for £8 4s. 2d., as well as &#8220;2 p<sup>r</sup> hand Irons&#8221;
for 15s. 5d., from Edmund Bagge. From George
Rust he bought &#8220;3 Cows &amp; Calves&#8221; for £7 10s., a
featherbed for £3 10s., and an &#8220;Iron pot&#8221; for 5s.</p>

<p>His reckoning with John Dogge opens with a
poignant note, &#8220;By a Child&#8217;s Coffin&#8221;: Mercer&#8217;s
first-born child had died. On the same account
was &#8220;an Oven,&#8221; bought for 17 shillings. Dogge
also was credited with &#8220;bringing over 10 sheep
from Sumners&#8221; (a plantation at Passapatanzy, south
of Potomac Creek). Rawleigh Chinn was paid for
&#8220;plowing up &amp; fencing in my yard&#8221; and for &#8220;fetching
3 horses over the Creek.&#8221; Also credited to Chinn
was an item revealing Mercer&#8217;s sporting enthusiasm:
&#8220;went on y<sup>e</sup> main race ... 15/.&#8221;</p>

<p>From Alexander Buncle, Mercer acquired one
dozen table knives, three chamber-door locks, two
pairs of candle snuffers, and two broad axes. His
account with Alexander McFarlane in 1726, the
credit side of which is quoted here in part, is a further
illustration of the variety of hardware and consumable
goods that he required:</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s comments, added three years later to this
record, signify the complexities of credit accounting
in the plantation economy: &#8220;In July 1729 I settled
Accounts w<sup>th</sup> M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Farlane &amp; paid him off &amp; at
the same time having Ed Barry&#8217;s note on him for
1412<sup>l</sup> Tob<sup>o</sup> (his goods being extravagantly dear) I
paid him 1450<sup>l</sup> Tob<sup>o</sup> to M<sup>r</sup> Thos Smith to ball<sup>ns</sup>
accts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another of Mercer&#8217;s accounts was with Edward
Simm. From Simm, Mercer acquired the following

<p class="title">ACQUIRING LAND
AND BUILDING A NEW HOUSE</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s first actual ownership of property came as
a result of his marriage. In 1725 he purchased from
his wife Catherine 885 acres of land near Potomac
Church for £221 5s. and another tract of 1610
acres on Potomac Run for £322.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> His occupancy
of the Ballard house, meanwhile, was arranged on a
most informal basis, three years having been allowed
to pass before he paid his first and only rent&mdash;a total
of 12 shillings&mdash;to his uncle-in-law David Waugh.</p>

<p>In January 1730 the following appears under
&#8220;Domestick Expenses&#8221;: &#8220;To bringing the frame of
my house from Jervers to Marlbro ... 40/.&#8221;
Associated with this are items for 2000 tenpenny nails,

&#8220;To John Chambers &amp; Robt Collins for bringing
Bricks &amp; Oyster Shells.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same month the account of Anthony Linton
and Henry Suddath includes the following:</p>

<p>Clearly, the Mercers had outgrown the temporary
shelter which the little Ballard house had given them.
Now a new house was under construction, with the
steps plainly indicated. To obtain timber of sufficient
size to frame the house it was necessary to go where
the trees grew. The nearest thickly forested area was
north of Potomac Creek and Potomac Run. The
appropriate timbers apparently grew on property
owned by Mercer but occupied by the widow of
James Jervis (or &#8220;Jervers&#8221;). Not only did the trees
grow there, but we may be sure that there they were
also felled, hewn, and cut, and the finished members
fitted together on the ground to form the frame of the
new house. It was a time-honored English building
practice to prepare the timbers where they were felled,
shaping them, drilling holes for &#8220;trunnels&#8221; (wooden
pegs or &#8220;tree nails&#8221;), inscribing coded numbers with
lumber markers, and then knocking the prefabricated
members apart and transporting them to the building
site.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Oystershells and bricks for the chimney were brought
from Cedar Point and Boyd&#8217;s Hole, south of Marlborough,
by Chambers and Collins. Shells were
probably burned at the house site to make lime for
mortar. Chambers was paid 12 pence a day for 32&frac12;
days&#8217; work spread over a period from October 1730 to
February 1731. Hugh French had been paid for 1000
bricks on August 24, 1730, while James Jones, on
October 3, 1730, was recompensed three shillings for
&#8220;9 days of work your Man plaistering my House &amp;
making 2 brick backs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>The new house was thus brought to completion
early in 1731. That it was a plain and simple house
is apparent from the small amount of labor and the
relatively few quantities of material. It appears to
have had two fireplaces only and one chimney.
Although the house was wooden, there is no evidence
that it had any paint whatsoever, inside or out.</p>


<p class="title">FURNISHING THE HOUSE</p>

<p>Other than a child&#8217;s chair and a bedstead costing
10 shillings, purchased from Enoch Innes in 1729,
little furniture was acquired before 1730. Listed in
&#8220;Domestick Expenses&#8221; for 1729-1730 are minor
accessories for the new house, such as HL hinges,
closet locks, a &#8220;scimmer,&#8221; a pair of brass candlesticks,
milk pans, pestle and mortar, &#8220;&frac12; doz plates,&#8221; a
&#8220;Cullender,&#8221; a candlebox, earthenware, and a
pepperbox, together with several handtools.</p>


<p class="title">MERCER&#8217;S VARIED ACTIVITIES AND INTERESTS</p>

<p>The agricultural aspects of a plantation were
increasingly in evidence. In 1729 Rawleigh Chinn
was paid for &#8220;helping to kill the Hogs,&#8221; &#8220;pasturage
of my cattle,&#8221; and &#8220;making a gate.&#8221; Edward Floyd
was credited with £4 6s. 7&frac12;d. for &#8220;Wintering Cattle,
taking care of my horse &amp; Sheep to Aug. 1729.&#8221;
John Chinn seems to have been Mercer&#8217;s jockey, for
as early as 1729 he was entering the races which
abounded in Virginia, and &#8220;went on y<sup>e</sup> race w<sup>th</sup> Colt
1729.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this early period we find considerable evidence
of a typical young Virginian&#8217;s fondness for gaming
and sport. One finds scattered through Mercer&#8217;s
account with Robert Spotswood such items as &#8220;To
won at the Race ... 8.9&#8221; and &#8220;To won at Liew at
Col<sup>o</sup> Mason&#8217;s ... 7.3.&#8221; (Loo was an elegant
18th-century game played with Chinese-carved
mother-of-pearl counters.) Mercer participated in
several sporting events at Stafford courthouse, for
court sessions continued, as in the previous century,
to be social as well as legal and political occasions.
This is illustrated in a credit to Joseph Waugh:
&#8220;By won at a horse race at Stafford Court and
Attorney&#8217;s fee ... £1.&#8221;; on the debit side of
Enoch Innes&#8217;s account: &#8220;To won at Quoits &amp;
running with you ... 1/3&#8221;; and in Thomas
Hudson&#8217;s account, where four shillings were marked
up &#8220;To won pitching at Stafford Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s diversions were few enough, nevertheless,
and it is apparent that he devoted more time to reading
than to gaming. In 1726 he borrowed from John
Graham (or Graeme) a library of 56 volumes belonging
to the &#8220;Hon<sup>ble</sup> Col<sup>o</sup> Spotswood&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> (<a href="#Page_191">Appendix E</a>).
Ranging from the Greek classics to English history,
and including Milton, Congreve, Dryden, Cole&#8217;s
Dictionary, &#8220;Williams&#8217; Mathematical Works,&#8221; and
&#8220;Present State of Russia,&#8221; they were the basis for a
solid education. That they included no lawbooks
at a time when Mercer was preparing for the law
is an indication of his broad taste for literature and
learning.</p>

<p>Marlborough, we can see, was occupied by a young
man of talent, energy, and creativity. He alone, of
the many men who had envisioned a center of
enterprise on Potomac Neck, was possessed of the
drive and the simple directness to make it succeed.
For George Mason and the Waughs, Mercer was the
ideal solution for their Marlborough difficulties.</p>

<h3>III<br />
<br />
<i>Mercer&#8217;s Consolidation
of Marlborough, 1730-1740</i></h3>


<p class="title">MERCER THE YOUNG LAWYER</p>

<p>The 1730&#8217;s opened a golden age in the Virginia
colony. There was an interval of peace in which
trade might flourish; there were new laws which
favored the tobacco planter and led to the building
of resplendent mansions along Virginia&#8217;s shores.
John Mercer wasted no time in grasping the opportunities
that lay about him. With shrewd foresight
he made law his major objective, thus raising himself
above most of his contemporaries. At the same
time he began an extensive purchasing of property,
so that within a decade he was to become one of the
major landed proprietors in the colony. Planting and
legal practice each augmented the other in Mercer&#8217;s
prosperity, which was assured by a classic combination
of energy, ability, and outgoing personality. As
with many successful men, Mercer had an eye for
meticulous detail; the documents he left behind were
a treasury of methodically kept records.</p>

<p>His Ledger B reveals that as early as 1730 his legal
career was becoming firmly established. It records
fee accounts, charges for drawing deeds, writing
bonds, and representing clients in various courts.
In that year he &#8220;subscribed to Laws of Virginia&#8221;
through William Parks, the Williamsburg printer and
stationer, and began to build up a substantial law
library, which was augmented by the purchase of
40 lawbooks from Robert Beverley.</p>


<p class="title">DIFFICULTIES IN ACQUIRING MARLBOROUGH</p>

<p>On October 13, 1730, Mercer obtained title from
David Waugh to the Ballard house and lots on the
basis of the &#8220;Statute for transforming uses into
possessions.&#8221; At the same time he acquired the three
lots originally granted to John Waugh, while nine
months later he was given the release of the three
lots inherited by George Mason from his father.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Mercer&#8217;s foothold in Marlborough was now secure.</p>

<p>Following these developments, he &#8220;employed the
County Surveyor to lay off the several Lots he had
purchased,&#8221; which led to the discovery of the previously
mentioned disparities and conflicts between
the Buckner survey of 1691 and the missing Gregg
survey of 1707. For some reason the town now lacked
feoffees, so Mercer &#8220;applied to the County Court of
Stafford on the tenth day of June one thousand seven
hundred and thirty-one and the said Court then
appointed Henry Fitzhugh Esquire and James
Markham Gent. Feofees of the said Town.&#8221; Mercer
stated that he &#8220;proposed making great Improvements
... and wanted to take up several other Lots
to build on.&#8221; The court thereupon ordered John
Savage, the county surveyor, to make a new survey,
&#8220;having regard to the Buildings and Improvements
then standing&#8221;&mdash;a significant instruction, intended no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
doubt to permit the reconciling of conflicting titles with
respect to what actually was built.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The new survey was laid out July 23, 1731, &#8220;in the
presence of the said Feoffees,&#8221; and drawn with the
same plan and numbering as Buckner&#8217;s, except that
an additional row of lots was applied along the western
border of the town, compressing slightly the former
lots as planned by Buckner and pushing them eastward
(<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>). This extra row, we have reason to
believe, was added with &#8220;regard to the Buildings and
Improvements then standing.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the time of the survey, the feoffees told Mercer
&#8220;that he might proceed in his Buildings and Improvements
on any the said Lots not before granted,&#8221;
promising that they would at any time make him
&#8220;any Title they could lawfully pass.&#8221; A proposal by
Fitzhugh to give title to any lots already purchased or
any which Mercer might take up under terms of the
Port Act of 1705 was discouraged by Mercer&#8217;s lawyer,
Mr. Hopkins, who took the view that, since the three
surveys conflicted, the deeds would not be good.
Accordingly, Fitzhugh and Mercer applied for an
&#8220;amicable Bill,&#8221; or suit in chancery, in the General
Court, in order &#8220;to have Savage&#8217;s or any particular
Survey established.&#8221; The request was shelved,
however, and still was unanswered in 1748.</p>

<p>The extra row of lots and the court&#8217;s instructions to
Savage to make his survey with &#8220;Regard to the
Buildings and Improvements then Standing&#8221; seem
to be correlated. Savage made a significant notation
on his survey plat: &#8220;The lots marked 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, &amp; 21 joining to the Creek are in possession of
Mr. John Mercer who claims them under Robinson,
Berryman, Pope &amp; Parry, &amp; under Ballard &amp; under
John Waugh dec<sup>ed</sup>, all w<sup>ch</sup> he says have been built
on and saved.&#8221; On the Buckner plat the lots bearing
these numbers comprise a block of six in the southwest
corner of the town, extending up from the
creek in two 3-tiered rows (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>). The plat included
the lots near the head of the &#8220;gutt&#8221; where the
courthouse appears to have stood, as well as the land
on which Structure B (the foundation of Mercer&#8217;s
mansion) was excavated. The lots appear in the
same relationship on Savage&#8217;s survey, except that the
new row bounds them on the west.</p>

<p>We know that the Robinson-Berryman-Pope-Parry
lot was the same lot originally granted to Robert
Alexander in 1691, numbered 19 on Buckner&#8217;s plat.
It was granted to its later owners according to the
Gregg survey in 1707, and was then described as
&#8220;being the first Lott known in the Survey Platt by
number 1.&#8221; From Mercer we have learned already
that Gregg made &#8220;his number 1 in the corner at
Buckner&#8217;s 19.&#8221; The other five lots were claimed
under Ballard and John Waugh. Waugh was
granted one lot in 1691&mdash;Buckner&#8217;s number 20&mdash;and
acquired two more in 1707. All three appear to have
been in the corner block of six lots. In any case,
these six lots equal the number of lots known to have
been granted the above-listed lot holders. Both of
Ballard&#8217;s lots were granted in 1707. His lot number
19 (Gregg survey), where Mercer first lived, is
described as &#8220;bounding Easterly with a lott surveyed
for Mr. John Waugh Westerly with a Narrow street
Northerly with a lott not yet surveyed, Southerly
with the first main Street which is parallel with
Potomac Creek.&#8221; We do not know which of Waugh&#8217;s
lots is meant, nor do we know Gregg&#8217;s street plan,
except that it was at odds with Buckner&#8217;s. But it is
probable that Ballard&#8217;s lot (Gregg&#8217;s number 19) was
the same as Buckner&#8217;s number 21, that the crosstown
street on Gregg&#8217;s plat lay to the south of the lot
rather than to the north of it, as on Buckner&#8217;s plat,
and that one of Waugh&#8217;s lots lay to the east of it.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Assuming that the two acres for the courthouse
were located near the head of the &#8220;gutt&#8221; and that
Ballard&#8217;s lot 19 was approximately the same as
Buckner&#8217;s 21, it is apparent that Ballard&#8217;s lot must
have overlapped the courthouse lots in the confusion
between the two surveys. Since Mercer was living
on Ballard&#8217;s lot, he probably infringed on the courthouse
property. Even though the courthouse had
been burned and abandoned, the two acres assigned
to it were required to revert to the original owner,
as provided in the Act of 1667, concerning church and
courthouse lands. In this case, the courthouse land,
having been &#8220;deserted,&#8221; had reverted to the heir
of Giles Brent.</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s embarrassment at this state of affairs
must have been great. However, the addition by
Savage of a whole new row of lots along the westerly
border of the town created new acreage, sufficient
both to reconcile the conflict and to provide compensatory
land to satisfy the Brents. Unfortunately,
the Savage survey, as we have noted, was not made
official, and Mercer was forced to continue his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
questionable occupancy of properties whose titles
were in doubt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

a Civil War period negative.) (<i>Courtesy of Historic American Buildings Survey, Library of
Congress.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>What is most significant to us in all this is the
inference that the courthouse, the Ballard house
which Mercer occupied, and the Structure B foundation
were all in close proximity.</p>


<p class="title">LARGE PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s next purchase of Marlborough property
was on July 28, 1737, when he bought the three lots
granted in 1691 to George Andrews from Andrews&#8217;
grandson, John Cave. Meanwhile, he began large-scale
acquisitions of lands elsewhere. By 1733 he
had acquired an aggregate of 8096 acres in Prince
William County. In addition, he obtained a &#8220;Lease
for three Lives&#8221; on three large tracts belonging to
William Brent, adjoining Marlborough, so that he
controlled virtually all of Potomac Neck.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Thus, after 1730 we find Mercer&#8217;s fortune already
well established and increasing. No longer a youthful
trader plying the Potomac in his sloop, he was
now a gentleman planter and influential lawyer.
He lived in a new house, owned some parts of
Marlborough, and was building &#8220;improvements&#8221;
on others. Almost overnight he had become a
landed proprietor.</p>


<p class="title">SUCCESS AT LAW AND CONFLICTS WITH LAWYERS</p>

<p>The source of Mercer&#8217;s newly made wealth is easily
discovered. His ledger shows an income from legal
fees in 1730 amounting to £291 10s. 1&frac12;d. In 1731
the figure climbed to £643 18s. 2d., then leveled off
to £639 11s. 2&frac12;d. the following year. For a young
man still in his twenties and self-trained in the law,
this was a remarkable achievement. His success
perhaps is attributable to a single event that stemmed
from youthful brashness and vigorous outspokenness.
Early in 1730, in a daring gesture on behalf of property
owners and taxpayers, he protested against privileges
granted in an act passed by the Assembly the previous
year &#8220;for encouraging Adventurers in Iron Works.&#8221;
Presented in the form of a proposition, the protest was
read before the Stafford court by Peter Hedgman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
The reaction to it in Williamsburg, once it had
reached the ears of the Assembly, was immediate and
angry. The House of Burgesses</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Resolv&#8217;d</i> That the Proposition from <i>Stafford</i> County
in relation to the Act past in the last Session of this
Assembly for encouraging Adventurers in Iron Works is

Colony.</p>

<p>Mercer and Hedgman made their apologies to the
House, received their reprimands, and paid their
fines. But this protest, so offensive to the dignity of
the lawmakers, had its effect in forcing amendments
to the act, particularly in removing the requirement
for building public roads leading from the ironworks
to the ore supplies and shipping points. To those
living in Stafford, particularly in the neighborhood
of the proposed Accokeek Ironworks, near Marlborough,
this concession must have elevated Mercer
to the level of a hero.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s frank disposition led him into other difficulties
during the first years of his practice. His
insistence on the prompt payment of debts and his
opposition to stays of execution following suits had
won him enemies at Prince William court. Charges
of improper legal activities were brought against him;
these were investigated at Williamsburg, with the
result that on June 13, 1734, he was suspended from
practicing law in Virginia for a period of six months.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>


<p class="title">TEMPORARY RETIREMENT, THE ABRIDGMENT,
AND GUARDIANSHIP OF GEORGE MASON</p>

<p>Deprived temporarily of his principal livelihood,
Mercer set out to write an <i>Abridgment of the Laws of</i>
<i>Virginia</i>. The task completed, he petitioned the
General Court on April 23, 1735, for &#8220;leave to Print
an Abridgment compil&#8217;d by him of all the Laws of
this Colony &amp; to have the benefit of the Sale thereof.&#8221;
On the same day he petitioned for a renewal of his
license, which was granted with the exception of the
right to practice in Prince William, where he was to
remain <i>persona non grata</i> generally thereafter.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Soon after these events his brother-in-law and old
acquaintance, George Mason, drowned. Mercer was
designated co-guardian of 10-year-old George Mason
IV, who came to live at Marlborough. Young George
later grew up to be the master of Gunston Hall and,
as the author of the Virginia Bill of Rights, to stand
among the intellectuals whose ideas influenced the
Revolution and the framing of the Constitution. In
these formative years, young George Mason surely
must have been affected by the strong legal mind and
cultivated tastes of his uncle.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>On October 14, 1737, the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> carried the
following advertisement:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This Day is Published</i></p>

<p>An Exact Abridgment of the Laws of VIRGINIA,
in Force and Use, to this present time. By</p>

<p class="quotsig">
John Mercer.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>At long last, after innumerable delays, the <i>Abridgment</i>
was in print. From a financial point of view it
was a conspicuous failure. Too few Virginians,
apparently, were sufficiently interested to buy it.</p>


<p class="title">DOMESTIC FURNISHINGS AND SERVANTS</p>

<p>During this eventful decade of the 1730&#8217;s Mercer
acquired the things needed for the proper maintenance
of his house and properties. One requisite was Negro
servants. From Pat Reyant he bought &#8220;a Girl
named Margaret&#8221; for 43 pounds of tobacco in 1730.
In 1731 he bought Deborah, Phillis, Peter, Nan, and
Bob. The following year he obtained Lucy, Will, and
George, and, in 1733, Nero. His purchases increased
as his landholdings increased. In 1736 he bought
five slaves, three of whom he aptly named Dublin,
Marlborough, and Stafford.</p>

<p>To help feed his slaves during this early period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Mercer apparently depended in part upon Stafford&#8217;s
wealth of natural resources. At least we find a
record of wild game entered on the same page and
under the same heading as his &#8220;Negroes&#8221; account
in the ledger. There it is noted that he purchased
42 ducks from Natt Hedgman on November 19, 1730,
and 20 ducks from Rawleigh Chinn the same day,
paying for them in powder and shot. Two swans and
a goose, as well as venison, appear on the list. Payment
for these was made in powder, shot, and wool.</p>

<p>He continued, meanwhile, to equip his house.
From John Foward (or Foard), a London merchant,
he bought a &#8220;frying pan&#8221; and &#8220;2 doz. bottles,&#8221;
&#8220;1 tomahawk,&#8221; &#8220;2 stock-locks,&#8221; &#8220;1 padlock,&#8221; &#8220;2 best
padlocks,&#8221; &#8220;1 drawingknife,&#8221; &#8220;9 p<sup>r</sup> hinges,&#8221; &#8220;3 clasp
knives,&#8221; and &#8220;1 gall. Maderas.&#8221; In April 1731, he
bought from Captain Foward:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Also in 1731 he bought &#8220;6 rush bottom Chairs&#8221;
for 17 shillings and a spinning wheel for 10 shillings
from William Hamitt. The &#8220;writing desk&#8221; which
he had bought in 1725 apparently needed extensive
and expensive repairs, for in March 1731 there
appears an item under &#8220;Domestick Expenses,&#8221; &#8220;To
W<sup>m</sup> Walker for mending Scoutore £1.&#8221; (<i>Scoutore</i>
was one of many corrupt spellings of <i>escritoire</i>, a
slant-top desk.) William Walker was a Stafford
County cabinetmaker and builder, about whom we
shall hear much more.</p>

<p>One of the most active accounts was that of Nathaniel
Chapman,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who directed the newly established
Accokeek Ironworks. In 1731 he sold Mercer
several hundred nails of different descriptions, a
variety of hoes, ploughs, wedges, door latches, and
heaters for smoothing irons. One item is &#8220;By putting
a leg in an old Iron Pott&#8221;; another is &#8220;By Col Mason
p<sup>d</sup> for mending a snuff box. 2.6&#8221; (<a href="#Page_193">Appendix F</a>).</p>

<p>In 1732 he paid Thomas Staines £1 for &#8220;a Cradle,&#8221;
&#8220;two Bedsteads,&#8221; and &#8220;a weekes work.&#8221; From John
Blane, during the same year, he purchased 2500 tenpenny
nails and the same quantity of eightpenny
nails. He also bought from Blane 4 &#8220;basons,&#8221; a
porringer, 100 needles, 2 penknives, a gross of &#8220;thread
buttons,&#8221; and a pair of large &#8220;Scissars.&#8221; Again, in
1732 he obtained from William Nisbett a quantity
of miscellaneous goods, including 10 parcels of earthenware
and a pewter dish weighing 4 to 5 ounces.
He also settled with Samuel Stevens for &#8220;your share
in making a Canoe.&#8221;</p>


<p class="title">TOBACCO WAREHOUSES</p>

<p>The Tobacco Act of 1730 provided for the erection
of public tobacco warehouses, and Marlborough was
selected as one of the sites.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In 1731 Mercer&#8217;s
account with John Waugh included &#8220;Timber for 2500
boards @25/.£3.2.6&#8221; and &#8220;Posts &amp; Ceils for two
Warehouses, 12 shillings.&#8221; In April 1732 he settled
accounts with Captain Henry Fitzhugh for &#8220;building
a Warehouse &amp; Wharf &amp; 6 prizes&#8221; at 3000 pounds of
tobacco, or £15. The prizes probably were &#8220;incentive
awards&#8221; for the workmen. Included in Fitzhugh&#8217;s
account were &#8220;3 days work of Caesar &amp; Will,&#8221;
ten shillings, and &#8220;4319 very bad Clapboards at &frac12;<sup>d</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
board.&#8221; On March 25 he paid Anthony Linton for
1820 clapboards, allowing him eight shillings for
&#8220;sawing of Boards.&#8221; The warehouses were in operation
in 1732, as we learn from Mercer&#8217;s &#8220;Account of
Inspectors,&#8221; but they suffered the fate of all official
enterprises at Marlborough, for in 1734 &#8220;the same
were put down, as being found very inconvenient.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The actual date of their termination was November 16,
1735, when a new warehouse was scheduled for completion
at the mouth of Aquia Creek.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The expression
&#8220;put down&#8221; does not seem to mean that the
warehouses were torn down, but that they were
officially discontinued. He apparently, however, continued
to use them for his own purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p class="title">PERSONAL ACTIVITIES</p>

<p>During the 1730&#8217;s Mercer recorded a minimum of
recreational activities. Those that he did list are
representative of the society of which he was a part.
Making wagers was a favorite amusement. For
example, he was owed £7 16s. by &#8220;Col<sup>o</sup> George
Braxton To a Wager you laid me at Cap<sup>t</sup> Rob<sup>t</sup>
Brooke&#8217;s house before M<sup>r</sup> James Reid, Will<sup>m</sup> Brooke
&amp;c. Six Guineas to one that Col<sup>o</sup> Spotswood would
not during the Reign of K. George that now is,
procure a Commission as Chief or Lieu<sup>t</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> of
Virginia.&#8221; In 1731 he paid William Brent &#8220;By a
pistole won of me about Hedgman&#8217;s wrestling with
and throwing Fra<sup>s</sup> Dade. £1.1.12.&#8221; He also paid
£2 10s. to James Markham &#8220;By [my] part on the
Race on Stotham&#8217;s horse.&#8221; There are other scattered
references to wagers on horseraces.</p>

including Loo, at which Mercer once won
7s. 3d. from Col. George Mason (III). These
examples, collected in Massachusetts, are probably
late 18th century. (USNM 61.399.)</span>
</div>

<p>Mercer had become a vestryman in Overwharton
Parish as early as 1730, and appears to have been
made responsible for all legal matters pertaining to
that church. His account, shown in detail in <a href="#Page_194">Appendix
G</a>, is of interest in showing that violations of moral
law were held accountable to the church and that
fines for convictions were paid to the church. Mercer,
representing the parish, collected a portion of each
fine as his fee.</p>

<p>Most of his energies now seem to have been divided
between the law and the substantial responsibilities
for managing his plantations. The increasing extent
of tobacco cultivation is revealed in the tobacco
account with &#8220;M<sup>r</sup> Jonathan Foward, Merchant in
London&#8221; (presumably John Foward, mentioned
earlier), extending from 1733 to 1743. This account
lists shipments of 129 hogsheads of tobacco, totaling
£643 1s. 11d. (if we include a few extraneous items,
such as &#8220;To an over charge in Lemons&#8221; and &#8220;To a
Still charg&#8217;d never sent&#8221;). Several similar accounts
involve proceeds from tobacco. In 1734 and 1738,
for example, he shipped 54 hogsheads to William
Stevenson, another London merchant, for £207 7d.
on the ships <i>Triton</i>, <i>Snake</i>, <i>Brooks</i>, and <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>Marlborough&#8217;s full transition to a seat of tobacco-planting
empire is now clearly discernible. In so
becoming, it was typical of the consolidation of
wealth, property, and power in Virginia as the
mid-century approached. Land had become both
a substitute for tobacco in lean years and the means
for paying off debts. The same land in better
years yielded crops to its new owners, so that a
relatively few dynamic men were able to amass
great wealth and form a ruling aristocracy. The
varieties of talents in men like Mercer&mdash;who, besides
being a planter, was an accomplished lawyer and
able administrator&mdash;placed them in the ascendancy
over their less able fellows. The vigor and ability
with which such men were endowed fostered the
remarkable class of leaders of the succeeding generation,
who had so much to do with founding the nation.</p>

<i>Marlborough at its Ascendancy,
1741-1750</i></h3>


<p class="title">TRAVEL</p>

<p>On April 12, 1741, Mercer was admitted to practice
at the General Court in Williamsburg.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> His trip
there on that occasion was typical of the journeys
which took him at least twice yearly to the capital.
On the first day of this Williamsburg trip he rode
&#8220;To Col<sup>o</sup> Taliaferro&#8217;s,&#8221; a distance of 19 miles.
The following day &#8220;To Caroline Court&#8221; (18 miles),
the next &#8220;To M<sup>r</sup> Hubbard&#8217;s&#8221; (30 miles), then as far
as &#8220;M<sup>r</sup> J<sup>no</sup> Powers&#8221; (24 miles), and finally &#8220;To
Furneas &amp; Williamsburg&#8221; (30 miles). The route
was usually to West Point, or Brick House on the
opposite shore in New Kent County, and thence
either directly to Williamsburg, or by way of New
Kent courthouse. Stopovers were made either at
ordinaries or at the houses of friends.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s travels, summarized in the journal that
he kept in the back of Ledger B from 1730 until his
death in 1768, were prodigious. In 1735, for example,
he journeyed a total of 4202 miles and was
home only 119 days. This pace had slackened
considerably in the period we are now considering,
but, nevertheless, he was not at home more than 218
days out of any one year of the decade 1741-1750.
This energetic and restless moving about was common
among the leading planters, but in Mercer&#8217;s case it
seems to have reached its ultimate. Practicing law,
playing politics, acquiring property, and becoming
acquainted with people led him all over Virginia.</p>

<p>A representative sample from the journal covers the
period of September and October 1745. It will be
noted that the days of the week are indicated alphabetically,
a through g, as in the calendar of the Book
of Common Prayer. The mileage traveled each day
is entered at the right.</p>

<p>[He remained at Williamsburg until November 6.]</p>

<p>Such itineraries were punctuated by periods of staying
at Marlborough, but even then there were day-long
journeys to Stafford courthouse, to church, or to
a survey. The courthouse, which succeeded that at
Marlborough, was situated on the south side of Potomac
Creek, about three miles upstream from the
old site. Mercer almost invariably took the 10-mile-long
land route through the site of the present village
of Brook, along the Fredericksburg road past Potomac
Church, then along the headwaters of Potomac Run
on a now-disused road leading to Belle Plains. Just
before reaching the courthouse, which stood on a rise
of land some distance back from the creek, he passed
&#8220;Salvington,&#8221; the mansion of Joseph Selden.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Near
the water, and in sight of the courthouse, stood the
house of John Cave, whose grandfather in 1707 had
bought his land from Sampson Darrell, undertaker
of the Marlborough courthouse.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Near it, on a
foundation still visible, Cave built the warehouse that
bore his name, and through him passed much of the
tobacco that Mercer raised locally. Occasionally,
when he had business to do at Cave&#8217;s, Mercer would
return home by water, as he did on August 14, 1746:</p>

<p class="title">VEHICLES</p>

<p>During the 1740&#8217;s Mercer&#8217;s travels were often by
chaise or chariot. We learn from Ledger G that he
bought &#8220;a fourwheel Chaise&#8221; from Charles Carter<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>in September 1744, a significant step in emulating
the manners and ways of Virginia&#8217;s established
aristocrats. Three years later he purchased &#8220;a Sett
of Chaisewheels&#8221; from Francis Hogans, a Caroline
County wheelwright, and in June 1748 he discounted
as an overcharge the cost of &#8220;a Chaise worth nothing&#8221;
in his account with the English mercantile firm of
Sydenham &amp; Hodgson.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> A &#8220;chaise&#8221; could have
been one of several types of vehicles, but it was
probably &#8220;a carriage for traveling, having a closed
body and seated for one to three persons,&#8221; according
to Murray&#8217;s <i>A New Oxford Dictionary</i>.</p>

Catherine. Sumner&#8217;s quarters at Passapatanzy is indicated by S, and Bull Run quarters

</div>

<p>In 1749 Mercer bought a &#8220;chariot&#8221; from James
Mills of Tappahannock for £80. Doubtless an
elegant piece of equipage, this was, we learn from
Murray, &#8220;a light four-wheeled carriage with only
back seats, and differing from the post-chaise in
having a coach-box.&#8221; In November 1750 he paid
John Simpson, a Fredericksburg wheelwright, 10
shillings for &#8220;wedging &amp; hooping the Chariotwheels&#8221;
and 9 shillings for &#8220;mending 3 fillys &amp; 3 Spokes in
D<sup>o</sup>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>At the same time he bought a &#8220;p<sup>r</sup> Cartwheels&#8221; for
£2 and a &#8220;Tumbling Cart&#8221; for £1 6s. from Simpson.
Murray tells us that a &#8220;tumble cart&#8221; or a &#8220;tumbril
cart&#8221; was a dung cart, designed to dump the load.</p>


<p class="title">TOBACCO CASK BRANDS</p>

<p>Hogsheads and casks of tobacco were branded with
the symbols or initials of the original owners. Many of
the brands are recorded explicitly in the ledger.
Mercer, at the beginning of his career, used a symbol
M. As his plantations multiplied, however, three
symbols were adopted, based on his own two initials.
Tobacco casks from Bull Run were marked <span class="smcap lowercase">I&nbsp;<sup>B</sup>.M</span>.
Those from Sumner&#8217;s Quarters bore the brand <span class="smcap lowercase">I&nbsp;<sup>S</sup>.M</span>,
while the &#8220;Home Plantation&#8221; at Marlborough had
casks marked <span class="smcap lowercase">I&nbsp;<sup>C</sup>.M</span> (<a href="#Fig_8">fig. 8</a>).</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="Fig_8" name="Fig_8"></a>
<img src="images/i_070.png" width="300" height="245" alt="" title="Wine-bottle seal" />
<span class="caption">Figure 8.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wine-bottle seal</span> on bottle excavated at
Marlborough, with same arrangement of initials
used in the Marlborough tobacco seal.</span>
</div>

<p>The interpretation of these symbols warrants some
digression. In the 17th century, and indeed in the
18th century also, the triangular cipher to indicate
the initials of man and wife was commonly used to
mark silver, pewter, china, delftware, linens, and other
objects needing owners&#8217; identifications. The common
surname initial was placed at the top, the husband&#8217;s
first-name initial at the lower left, and the wife&#8217;s at
the lower right. This arrangement was used consistently
in the 17th century. In the 18th century,
however, variations began to appear in the colonies,
although not, apparently, in England. Silver made
in New York and Philadelphia during the 1700&#8217;s
presents the initials reading from left to right, with
the husband&#8217;s at the lower left, the wife&#8217;s at top
center, and the surname initial at the lower right.
The large keystone of the Carlyle house in Alexandria,
built in 1751, bears a triangular arrangement of John
and Sarah Carlyle&#8217;s initials: <span class="smcap lowercase">J&nbsp;<sup>S</sup>.C</span>.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Like Carlyle, Mercer used initials in this fashion,
but also, as we have seen, in two other combinations
in which &#8220;J. M.&#8221; remains constant, the upper center
initial having a subordinate significance. &#8220;S&#8221; signifies
Sumner&#8217;s Quarters, and &#8220;B,&#8221; Bull Run Quarters.
&#8220;C&#8221; on seals and brands having to do with Marlborough
apparently refers to Catherine, honoring her
as Mercer&#8217;s wife and mistress of the home plantation.
The possibility that &#8220;C&#8221; stands for Cave&#8217;s warehouse
may be dismissed as being inconsistent with the other
two marks, the tobacco from Sumner&#8217;s Quarters
having also been shipped through Cave&#8217;s, and that
from Bull Run Quarters having been stored at the
Occaquan warehouse.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>John Withers also used the left-to-right arrangement,
<span class="smcap lowercase">I&nbsp;<sup>H</sup>.W</span>, although Henry Tyler, a planter whose
account is mentioned in Mercer&#8217;s Ledger, used the
conventional three-letter cipher, <span class="smcap lowercase">H&nbsp;<sup>T</sup>.M</span>. These marks
occurred on casks transmitted to Mercer as payments,
and are recorded in Ledger G (<a href="#Fig_7">fig. 7</a>).</p>


<p class="title">TOBACCO EXCHANGE</p>

<p>Tobacco, before being transferred to another owner,
was examined by official inspectors. Mercer kept a
special &#8220;Inspector&#8217;s Notes&#8221; account where he kept
track of fees due the inspectors. Direct payments of
tobacco were made in transactions with William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Hunter and Charles Dick, the Fredericksburg merchants
from whom Mercer bought most of his goods
and supplies. To others, however, payments were
made in a complexity of tobacco notes, legal-fee
payments, and plain barter. Tobacco shipped overseas
was usually handled by Sydenham &amp; Hodgson.
Also involved with tobacco transactions in England
were two Virginia merchants, Major John Champe,
a distinguished resident of King George County
who lived at Lamb&#8217;s Creek plantation, and William
Jordan, of Richmond County, both of whom arranged
for purchases of books, furniture, and other
English imports for Mercer.</p>

Hodgson&#8217;s account in Ledger G:</p>

<p>Between 1747 and 1750 Mercer lost a total of 107
hogsheads of tobacco. Over and above this, however,
he shipped overseas tobacco to the amount of
£385 11s. 7d., during the same period.</p>


<p class="title">CLIENTS</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s success was gained despite the failures
of a great many persons to pay the fees they owed
him. In 1745 he listed 303 &#8220;Insolvents, bad &amp;
doubtful debts.&#8221; That matters were no worse may
be attributed to a high average of responsible clients.
Among them were such well-known Virginians as
Daniel Dulaney, William and Henry Fitzhugh,
William Randolph, Augustine, John, and Lawrence
Washington, Gerard Fowke, Richard Taliaferro,
John and Daniel Parke Custis, Andrew and Thomas
Monroe, George Tayloe, George Lee, George Wythe,
and William Ramsay.</p>

<p class="title">CLOTHING</p>

<p>By the early 1740&#8217;s Mercer was in a position to
surround himself with symbols of wealth and prestige.
Clothes, a traditional measure of affluence, were now
a growing concern for himself and his family. Between
1741 and 1744, the ledger reveals, he purchased
from William Hunter a greatcoat, women&#8217;s stockings,
women&#8217;s calf shoes, morocco pumps, a &#8220;fine hat,&#8221;
three felt hats, two dozen &#8220;plaid hose,&#8221; two pairs of
men&#8217;s shoes, one pair of &#8220;Women&#8217;s Spanish Shoes,&#8221;
and &#8220;2 p<sup>r</sup> Calf D<sup>o</sup>.&#8221; In 1744 and 1745 he bought
from Charles Dick two pairs of &#8220;women&#8217;s coll&#8217;<sup>d</sup>
lamb gloves,&#8221; two pairs of silk stockings, &#8220;1 velvet
laced hood,&#8221; a &#8220;laced hat,&#8221; a &#8220;Castor&#8221; (i.e., beaver)
hat, &#8220;fine thread stockings,&#8221; silk handkerchiefs, a
&#8220;flower&#8217;d pettycoat,&#8221; worsted stockings, and buckskin
gloves. From Hugh MacLane, a Stafford
tailor, he obtained a suit in 1745.</p>

<p>The rise in Mercer&#8217;s wealth and prestige is reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
in his patronizing Williamsburg tailors, beginning
in 1745 when he settled with George Charleston for
a tailor&#8217;s bill of £6 10s. In 1748 he paid Charleston
four shillings for &#8220;Collar lining a Velvet Waistcoat.&#8221;
In 1749 he purchased a &#8220;full trimm&#8217;d velvet Suit&#8221;
from Charles Jones, the work and materials totaling
£7 7s. 4&frac14;d., while in 1750 he spent £11 2s. 1&frac12;d.
on unitemized purchases from the same tailor.
In that year he bought also from Robert Crichton, a
Williamsburg merchant, &#8220;a flower&#8217;d Velvet Waistcoat,
£5.&#8221; As the decade advanced, Mercer played
with increasing consciousness the role of wealthy
gentleman, as his choice of tailors shows.</p>


<p class="title">MATERIALS</p>

<p>Textile materials, as seen under &#8220;General Expenses&#8221;
and in the accounts of Hunter and Dick,
ran the gamut of the usual imported fabrics, as well
as rare, expensive elegancies. An alphabetical list
of the materials mentioned in these accounts, with
definitions, is given in <a href="#Page_196">Appendix I</a>.</p>

<p>From this list we gain an impression of great
diversity and refinement in the materials used for
clothing and interior decoration, as well as of a
tremendous amount of sewing, embroidering, and
making of clothes at home, probably typical of most
of the great plantations in the middle of the century.</p>


<p class="title">WEAVING</p>

<p>In addition to fine imported materials, there were
needed blankets, work clothes for slaves, and fabrics
for other practical purposes. To these ends Mercer
employed several weavers in various parts of Virginia.
In 1747 William Threlkeld wove 109 yards of woolen
cloth at fourpence a yard. During that year and the
next, John Booth of King George County wove an
indeterminate amount for a total of £2 4d. In 1748
John Fitzpatrick wove 480 yards of cotton at fourpence
a yard, and William Mills wove 30 yards of
&#8220;cloath.&#8221; Much of the work appears to have been
done in payment for legal services.</p>

<p>Weaving and spinning evidently were done at
Marlborough, as they were at most plantations. In
1744 Mercer recorded under &#8220;General Charges&#8221; that
he had sold a loom to Joseph Foxhall. In 1746 he
bought a spinning wheel from Captain Wilson of
Whitehaven, England, purchasing three more from
him in 1748. Wool cards also appear in the accounts.
In January 1748 Mercer charged William Mills with
&#8220;3 months Hire of Thuanus the Weaver, £3,&#8221; which
suggests that Thuanus was an indentured white
servant (his name does not occur on the list of slaves)
employed at Marlborough and hired out to Mills, a
Stafford County weaver.</p>


<p class="title">PERSONAL ACCESSORIES</p>

<p>In contrast to the elegancies of dress materials and
clothing, Mercer left little evidence of jewelry, toilet
articles, or other personal objects. In Ledger G we
find &#8220;2 horn combs&#8221; bought for fivepence, an ivory
comb for tenpence, two razors, two strops, snuff-boxes,
bottles of snuff, &#8220;a smelling bottle,&#8221; and &#8220;buck-handled&#8221;
and silver-handled penknives. From John
Hyndman, a Williamsburg merchant, Mercer acquired
a set of silver buckles for £1 10s., and from William
Woodford he bought &#8220;a gold watch, Chain &amp; Swivel&#8221;
for the not-trifling sum of £64 6s. 3d.</p>

<p>Like most successful men, Mercer had his portrait
painted. During the General Court sessions held
in the spring and fall of 1748 in Williamsburg, he
lodged with William Dering, the dancing master and
portrait painter. Dering lived in the house still
standing on the capitol green, now known as the
Brush-Everard house. In Dering&#8217;s account we find:
&#8220;by drawing my picture, £9.2.9.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>


<p class="title">FOOD AND DRINK</p>

<p>Good food and drink played an important part in
Mercer&#8217;s life, as it did in the lives of most Virginia
planters. In the ledger accounts are found both
double-refined and single-refined sugar, bohea tea,
coffee, nutmegs, cinnamon, mace, and chocolate.
Most meats were provided by the plantation and
thus are not mentioned, while fish were caught from
the plantation sloop or by fixed nets. However,
Thomas Tyler of the Eastern Shore sold Mercer a
barrel of drumfish and four and one-half bushels of
oysters, while Thomas Jones, also of the Eastern Shore,
provided a barrel of pork for 47s. 6d. in 1749. Earlier
there appeared a ledger item under &#8220;General
Charges&#8221; for 1775 pounds of pork.</p>

<p>Molasses was an important staple, and Mercer
bought a 31-gallon barrel of it from one &#8220;Captain
Fitz of the Eastern Shore of Maryland&#8221; in 1746 and
30 gallons the next year, charging both purchases to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
his wife. In 1750 he received 88 gallons of molasses
and 255 pounds of &#8220;muscovy sugar&#8221; from Robert
Todd. Muscovy sugar was the same as &#8220;muscavado&#8221;
sugar, the unrefined brown sugar of the West Indies,
known in Spanish as <i>mascabado</i>.</p>

<p>Beverages and the fruits to go with them were
bought in astonishing quantities between 1744 and
1750. Major Robert Tucker, a Norfolk merchant,
exchanged a &#8220;Pipe of Wine&#8221; worth £26 and a 107&frac12;-gallon
hogshead of rum valued at £22 in return for
Mercer&#8217;s legal services. Again as a legal fee, Mercer
received 55 gallons of &#8220;Syder&#8221; from Janet Holbrook
of Stafford and bought 11 limes from John Mitchelson
of York for 12 shillings. From William Black he
purchased &#8220;11 dozen and 11 bottles of Ale&#8221; at 13
shillings, and from John Harvey &#8220;5&nbsp;&#8543;<sub>12</sub> dozen of
Claret&#8221; for £11 6d. &#8220;Mark Talbott of the Kingdom
of Ireland E<sup>sq</sup>&#8221; sold Mercer a pipe of wine for £3 3s.</p>


<p class="title">LIFE OF THE CHILDREN</p>

<p>During the 1740&#8217;s Mercer&#8217;s first four surviving
children, George, John Fenton, James, and Sarah
Ann Mason Mercer,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> were growing up, and the
accounts are scattered through with items pertaining
to their care and upbringing. There are delightful
little hints of Mercer&#8217;s role as the affectionate father.
On May 17, 1743, &#8220;By Sundry Toys&#8221; appears in
Hunter&#8217;s account; an item of &#8220;1 horses 1<sup>d</sup>&#8221; in Dick&#8217;s
account for 1745 was undoubtedly a toy. Most
charming of all the entries in the latter account is
&#8220;1 Coach in a box 6<sup>d</sup>. 4 Toys. 8<sup>d</sup>, 2 Singing birds.&#8221;
The birds may have occupied a birdcage and stand
bought from George Rock, the account for which
was settled a year later.</p>

a &#8220;french horn&#8221; like this from Charles Dick

</div>

<p>&#8220;1 french horn&#8221; and &#8220;3 trumpets&#8221; are listed in the
Dick account. The horn was probably used in
hunting; the three trumpets were bought perhaps
for the three boys. Mercer&#8217;s library contained one
book of music entitled <i>The Musical Miscellany</i>, which
may have furnished the scores for a boyish trio of
trumpets. Music and dancing were a part of the
life at Marlborough, and in 1745 an entry under
&#8220;General Charges&#8221; reads &#8220;To DeKeyser for a years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>

year ninepence was paid William Allan &#8220;for his
Fidler.&#8221; In 1747 &#8220;Fiddle strings&#8221; were bought from
Fielding Lewis in Fredericksburg for 2s. 4&frac12;d.</p>

General Account in 1743. It probably resembled
this typical hornbook in the collection of
Mrs. Arthur M. Greenwood.</span>
</div>

<p>From the ledger we also learn much about the
children&#8217;s clothing: child&#8217;s mittens and child&#8217;s shoes,
boy&#8217;s pumps, boy&#8217;s shoes, girl&#8217;s shoes, boy&#8217;s collared
lamb gloves, two pairs of &#8220;girl&#8217;s clock&#8217;d Stocking,&#8221;
&#8220;2 p<sup>r</sup> large boys Shoes 6<sup>l</sup> 2 p<sup>r</sup> smaller 5/ ... 1 p<sup>r</sup>
girls 22<sup>d</sup>, 1 p<sup>r</sup> smaller 20<sup>d</sup>,&#8221; boy&#8217;s gloves, and &#8220;Making
a vest and breeches for George&#8221; in October 1745.
In 1748 Captain Wilson brought from England &#8220;a
Wig for George,&#8221; worth 12 shillings. George then
had reached the age of 15 and young manhood.
Hugh MacLane, the Stafford tailor, was employed to
make clothes for the three boys&mdash;a suit for George,
and a suit, vest, coat, and breeches each for James and
John.</p>

<p>That the children were educated according to time-honored
methods is revealed in the &#8220;General Expenses&#8221;
account for May 1743, where &#8220;1 hornbook
3<sup>d</sup>&#8221; is entered. The hornbook was an ancient instructional
device consisting of a paddle-shaped piece of
wood with the alphabet and the Lord&#8217;s Prayer printed
or otherwise lettered on paper that was glued to the
wood and covered for protection with thin sheets of
transparent horn. Elaborate examples sometimes
were covered with tooled leather, or were made of
ivory, silver, or pewter. The mention of hornbooks
in colonial records is a great rarity, although they
were commonplace in England until about 1800.</p>

<p>The Mercer children were taught by private tutors.
One, evidently engaged in England, was the Reverend
John Phipps, who was paid a salary of £100
annually and, presumably, his board and lodging.
Mercer noted in his journal on November 18, 1746,
that &#8220;Mr Phipps came to Virginia.&#8221; That Mr.
Phipps left something to be desired was revealed
years later in the letter written in 1768 by John to
George Mercer, who was then in England, asking
him to find a tutor for his younger children: &#8220;...
the person you engage may not pretend, as M<sup>r</sup>
Phipps did that tho&#8217; he undertook to instruct my
children he intended boys only, &amp; I or my wife
might teach the girls. As I have mentioned M<sup>r</sup>
Phipps, it must remind you that a tutor&#8217;s good nature
&amp; agreeable temper are absolutely necessary both
for his own ease &amp; that of the whole family.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>In 1750 George entered the College of William
and Mary. He had a room at William Dering&#8217;s
house, and the account of &#8220;Son&#8217;s Maintenance at
Williamsburg&#8221; provides an interesting picture of a
well-to-do college-boy&#8217;s expenses, chargeable to his
father. Such items as &#8220;To Cash p<sup>d</sup> for Lottery
Tickets&#8221; (£7 10s. 6d.), &#8220;To Covington the Dancing
Master ... 2.3,&#8221; &#8220;To W<sup>m</sup> Thomson for Taylor&#8217;s
work&#8221; (£1 9s. 6d.), &#8220;To p<sup>d</sup> for Washing&#8221; (£1 1s.),
and &#8220;To Books for sundrys&#8221; (£22 4s. 7&frac12;d.) show a
variety of obligations comparable to those sometimes
encountered on a modern campus. The entire
account appears in <a href="#Page_197">Appendix J</a>.</p>


<p class="title">BUILDING THE MANOR HOUSE</p>

<p>As early as 1742 the ledger shows that Mercer
was building steadily, although the nature of what
he built is rarely indicated. Hunter&#8217;s account for
1742 lists 2500 tenpenny nails and 1000 twenty-penny
nails, while in the following year the same account
shows a total of 4200 eightpenny nails, 5000 tenpenny,
2000 fourpenny, and 1000 threepenny nails.
The following tools were bought from Hunter in
1744: paring chisel, 1&frac12;-inch auger, &frac34;-inch auger,
socket gouge, broad axe, adze, drawing knife, mortice
chisel, a &#8220;square Rabbit plane,&#8221; and &#8220;plough
Iron &amp; plains.&#8221; In Charles Dick&#8217;s account we find
purchases in 1745 of 16,000 flooring brads, 4000
twenty-penny nails, 2000 each of fourpenny, sixpenny,
eightpenny, and tenpenny brads, and 60,000 fourpenny
nails.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1744 Mercer made great purchases of
lumber. Thomas Tyler of the Eastern Shore sold him
2463 feet of plank in that year, and in 1745 made
several transactions totaling 5598 feet of 1-, 1&frac12;-,
and 2-inch plank, as well as 23,170 shingles. In 1746
Charles Waller of Stafford sold Mercer 5193 feet of
1-, 1&frac14;-, and 1&frac12;-inch plank. In the same year James
Waughhop of Maryland provided &#8220;4000 foot of Plank
of different thicknesses for £12,&#8221; and in May 1749,
&#8220;2300 foot of 1&frac12; Inch Plank at 7/.&#8221; Mercer made
several similar purchases, including 14,700 shingles,
from Robert Taylor of the Eastern Shore.</p>

<p>Where all these materials were used is a matter for
conjecture. We know that Mercer made &#8220;Improvements&#8221;
to the extent of &#8220;saving&#8221; 40 lots under the
terms of the Act for Ports and Towns, and that a
great deal of construction work, therefore, was going
on. One building was probably a replacement for a
warehouse, for a laconic entry in his journal on New
Year&#8217;s day of 1746 notes that &#8220;My warehouses burnt.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
These were doubtless the buildings erected in 1732
and officially vacated in 1735. That at least one
eventually was rebuilt for Mercer&#8217;s own use is known
from an overseer&#8217;s report of 1771 (<a href="#Page_211">Appendix M</a>).</p>

<p>The windmill, the foundations of which still remain
in part near the Potomac shore, was probably built in
1746. Mercer&#8217;s cash account for that year includes
an item of 2s. 6d. for &#8220;Setting up Mill,&#8221; which
apparently meant adjusting the millstones for proper
operation. In August he paid Nathaniel Chapman
£22 19s. 8&frac34;d. &#8220;in full for Smith&#8217;s work.&#8221; A windmill,
with its bearings, levers, lifts, and shafts, would seem
to have been the only structure requiring such a costly
amount of ironwork.</p>

<p>The most elaborate project of all, however, is clearly
discernible in the ledger. In 1746 Thomas Anderson,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
in consideration of cash and legal services,
charged for &#8220;making &amp; burning 40<sup>m</sup> Stock bricks&#8221; at
4 pounds 6 pence per 1000. In the same year David
Minitree, described by Mercer as a &#8220;Bricklayer,&#8221;
came to Marlborough from Williamsburg. Minitree
was more than an ordinary bricklayer, however, for
he had worked on the Mattaponi church, and later,
between 1750 and 1753, was to build Carter&#8217;s Grove
for Carter Burwell.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The credit side of Minitree&#8217;s account in Ledger G

</table></div>

<p>The last item, in particular, is clear indication that
an architectural project of importance was underway
and that Mercer had set about to make Marlborough
the equal of Virginia&#8217;s great plantations. Only &#8220;part
of my house&#8221; was built by Minitree, yet his bill was
more than five times the total cost of Mercer&#8217;s
previous house, completed in 1730!</p>

<p>Since it was customary in Virginia to make bricks
on the site of a new house, utilizing the underlying
clay excavated from the foundation, Minitree, as well
as Anderson, made his bricks at Marlborough before
using them. Mortar for laying bricks was made of
lime from oystershells. In 1747 and 1748, we learn
from the ledger, 61&frac12; hogsheads of oystershells were
bought from Abraham Basnett, an &#8220;Oysterman,&#8221;
payment having been made in cash, meat, and
brandy. &#8220;Flagstones &amp;c &#8221; were obtained in 1747
through Major John Champe at a cost of £36 4s. 6d.
These may have been the same stones brought up as
&#8220;a load of stone&#8221; by &#8220;Boatswain Davis&#8221; of Boyd&#8217;s
Hole in Passapatanzy in October 1747 for £4 5s. 5d.</p>

<p>Early in 1748 a new set of developments concerning
the house took place. Major William Walker of
Stafford, revealed in the journal and the ledgers as
an old acquaintance of Mercer&#8217;s, then became the
&#8220;undertaker,&#8221; or contractor, for the house. Walker
was a talented man who had started out as a cabinetmaker,
a craft in which his brother Robert still
continued. Whiffen (<i>The Public Buildings of Williamsburg</i>)
shows that he both designed and built a glebe
house for St. Paul&#8217;s Parish, Hanover County, in
1739-1740, and the steeple for St. Peter&#8217;s Church in
New Kent the latter year. Also in 1740 he built a
bridge across the Pamunkey for Hanover County. At
the same time that he was engaged on Mercer&#8217;s
mansion, he undertook in March 1749 to rebuild the
burned capitol at Williamsburg. He died 11 months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
later before bringing either of these major projects
to completion.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Walker&#8217;s carpenter was William Monday. Mercer
settled with Monday in March 1748 for a total bill
of £126 16s. 2&frac12;d., but with a protest addressed
to himself in the ledger: &#8220;By work done about my
House which is not near the value as by Maj<sup>r</sup> Walker&#8217;s
Estimate below, yet to avoid Disputes &amp; as he is
worth nothing I give him Credit to make a full
Ballance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, William Bromley, a joiner, had gone
to work on the interior finish. Like Minitree and
Walker, Bromley represented the highest caliber of
artisanship in the colony. Eighteen years later
Mercer referred to Bromley, &#8220;who,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
believe was the best architect that ever was in
America.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Bromley employed several apprentices,
among them an Irishman named Patterson.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> For
the interval from July 9, 1748, to December 25,
1750, Bromley was paid £140 1s. &frac12;d., almost
entirely for wages. The payment included &#8220;3 p<sup>r</sup>
hollows &amp; rounds / 6 plane irons / 1 gallon Brandy.&#8221;
For the same period Andrew Beaty, also a joiner,
received £113 5s. 1&frac12;d. On June 19, 1749, Mercer
noted in his journal, &#8220;Beaty&#8217;s apprentice came to
work.&#8221; These men were specialists in framing
woodwork and in making paneling, doors, wainscoting,
and exterior architectural elements of wood.</p>

<p>The opulence of the building&#8217;s finish is indicated
by a charge on Walker&#8217;s account for &#8220;his Carver&#8217;s
work 69 days at 5/, £17. 15....&#8221; Previously,
while Minitree was still working on the house, an
item had been entered in August 1747, &#8220;To Cash
paid for cutting the Chimneypiece ... 6.3.&#8221; A
chimneypiece was usually the ornamental trim or
facing around a fireplace opening, although in this
instance the overpanel may have been meant.</p>

<p>Jacob Williams, a plasterer, worked 142&frac12; days
for a total of £22 4s. 4d., while his helper Joseph
Burges was employed 43 days for £5 7s. 6d.
Walker charged £3 8s. 11d. for &#8220;his Painters work
about my house,&#8221; and a purchase of &#8220;42 gallons of
Linseed Oyl&#8221; was recorded in the general charges
account. Three books of goldleaf, which Mercer
had obtained from George Gilmer, the Williamsburg
apothecary, were charged, together with paint, to
Walker.</p>

<p>In May 1750, a charge by George Elliot, &#8220;Turner,
Stafford,&#8221; was recorded, &#8220;By turning 162 Ballusters
at 6<sup>d</sup>, £4.1....&#8221; Another item, for supplying
&#8220;341&frac12; feet Walnut Plank at 2<sup>d</sup>,&#8221; settled in October,
may have been for the wood of which the balusters
were made.</p>

<p>Thomas Barry, &#8220;Bricklayer,&#8221; carried on the work
that Minitree had not completed. His account for
1749 follows:</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that bricks, probably carried
from England as ballast, were brought by Captain
Lyndon.</p>

William Copein, a Prince William County mason,
and Job Wigley were employed together in 1749
to the amount of £2 8s. In 1750 Copein was paid
by Mercer for 64 days of work at 3s. 1d. per day,
totaling £9 17s. 4d. Copein was another accomplished
craftsman, the marks of whose skill still are
to be seen in the carved stone doorways of Aquia
Church in Stafford County and in the baptismal font
at Pohick Church in Fairfax.</p>

<p>The design of the house will be considered in more
detail later in the light of both archeological and
documentary evidence. It is already quite clear,
however, that the new mansion was remarkably
elaborate, reflecting the workmanship of some of
Virginia&#8217;s best craftsmen. The most significant clues
to its inspiration are found in the titles of four books
which Mercer purchased in 1747. These are listed
in the inventory of his books in Ledger G as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hoppne&#8217;s Architecture.&#8221; This was probably <i>The Gentlemans
and Builders Repository on Architecture Displayed.
Designs Regulated and Drawn by E. Hoppus, and engraved by
B. Cole. Containing useful and requisite problems in geometry
... etc</i>, (1738). Edward Hoppus was &#8220;Surveyor to
the Corporation of the London Assurance.&#8221; He also
edited Salmon&#8217;s <i>Palladio Londonensis</i>. We find no writer
on architecture named Hoppne and assume this was a
mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Salmon&#8217;s Palladio Londonensis.&#8221; <i>Palladio Londonensis:
or the London Art of Building</i>, by William Salmon, which
appeared in at least two editions, in 1734 and in 1738,
had a profound influence on the formal architecture of
the colonies during the mid-century.</p>

<p>&#8220;Palladio&#8217;s Architecture.&#8221; The Italian Andrea Palladio
was the underlying source of English architectural thought
from Christopher Wren down to Robert Adam. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a><br /><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the patronage of Lord Burlington, this book was brought
out in London in an English translation by Giacomo
Leoni under the title <i>The Architecture of A. Palladio; in Four
Books</i>. It had appeared in three editions prior to this
inventory, in 1715, 1721, and 1742, according to Fiske
Kimball (<i>Domestic Architecture of the American Colonies
and of the Early Republic</i>; New York: Charles Scribner&#8217;s
Sons, 1924, p. 58). Mercer probably owned one of these.
&#8220;Langley&#8217;s City &amp; Country Builder.&#8221; <i>City and Country
Builder&#8217;s and Workman&#8217;s Treasury of Design</i> by Battey
Langley, 1740, 1745. This was another copybook much
used by builders and provincial architects.</p></blockquote>

on Mercer&#8217;s mansion. (<i>Courtesy of the Library of Congress.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>All four of these books were listed in succession in
the ledger and bracketed together. Next to the
bracket are the initials &#8220;WB,&#8221; to indicate that the
books had been lent to someone who bore those
initials. In this case it is virtually certain that the
initials are those of William Bromley, to whom the
books would have been of utmost importance in
designing the woodwork of the house.</p>

<p>Door hardware was purchased from William Jordan
in June 1749, according to an item for &#8220;Locks &amp;
Hinges&#8221; that amounted to the large sum of £13 8s. 8d.</p>


<p class="title">DOMESTIC FURNISHINGS</p>

<p>As the mansion progressed, so did the acquisition of
furnishings suitable to its elegance. As early as 1742,
doubtless in anticipation of the new house, Mercer
had bought from Hunter a &#8220;lanthorn,&#8221; three porringers,
two cotton counterpanes at 27s., a plate
warmer for 7s. 6d., a half-dozen plates for 3s. 6d., a
half-dozen deep plates for 6s., a dozen &#8220;Stone Coffee
cups&#8221; for 18d., a dozen knives and forks for 3s., two
tin saucepans at 4d. each, and &#8220;4 Dishes, 19&frac12; lib.&#8221;
(obviously large pewter chargers). In 1743 he
bought &#8220;5 gallon Basons 4/7&#8221; and &#8220;2 pottle Basons at
2/4&#8221; (for toilet use), &#8220;1 Soop Spoon 1/,&#8221; and &#8220;1
Copper Chocolate pot 7/6 &amp; mull Stick 6<sup>d</sup>,&#8221; &#8220;2 blew
&amp; W<sup>t</sup> Jugs 2/&#8221; (probably Westerwald stoneware),
and &#8220;1 Flanders Bed Bunt, 25&#8221; (colored cotton or
linen used for bedcovers).</p>

<p>In 1744 Mercer acquired from Charles Dick 4
candlesticks for a penny each, 2 pairs of large hinges,
a &#8220;hair sifter,&#8221; &#8220;2 kitchen buck hand knives,&#8221; 12 cups
and saucers for 2s., &#8220;1 milkmaid 2<sup>d</sup>&#8221; (probably a
shoulder yoke), and &#8220;1 bucket &frac12;<sup>d</sup>.&#8221; In 1745 a
5-gallon &#8220;Stone bottle&#8221; for 3s. 6d., &#8220;1 doz. butcher
knives,&#8221; a hearthbroom, six spoons for a shilling, a
pair of scissors, &#8220;8 Chamberdoor Locks w<sup>th</sup> brass
knobs £2,&#8221; and &#8220;1 Sett finest China 35/, 2 punch
bowls ... 2.7&#8221; were purchased.</p>

<p>The following year Mercer paid a total of £23 for a
silver sugar dish, weighing 8 oz., 5 dwt.; one dozen
teaspoons and tray, 8 oz., 7 dwt.; a teapot and frame,
26 oz., 8 dwt. This lot of silver probably was bought
at second hand, having been referred to as &#8220;Pugh&#8217;s
Plate p<sup>d</sup> Edw<sup>d</sup> Wright as by Rec<sup>t</sup>.&#8221; He paid John
Coke, a Williamsburg silversmith, £1 6s. for engraving
and cleaning it. In the meanwhile, in 1745, he
had sold Coke £6 worth of old silver. He also sold a
quantity of &#8220;old Plate&#8221; for £15 17s. 3d. to Richard
Langton in England through Sydenham &amp; Hodgson.
In 1747 he made a large purchase of silver from the
silversmith William King<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> of Williamsburg:</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 13.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Table-desk</span> made in 1749 for Henry
Purefoy of Shalstone Manor in Buckinghamshire by
John Belchier of London. In the following year,
John Mercer received £43 13s. worth of &#8220;Cabinet
Ware&#8221; from that noted cabinetmaker. (<i>Reproduced

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Meanwhile, William Walker&#8217;s brother Robert made
14 chairs for Mercer, on which William&#8217;s carver spent
54 days. The total cost was £30 8s. The quality of
Mercer&#8217;s furniture is illustrated further by a purchase
in 1750 from Lyonel Lyde,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> a London merchant,
of £43 13s. worth of &#8220;Cabinet Ware from
Belchier.&#8221; Belchier was a leading London furniture
maker, whose shop in 1750 was located on the &#8220;south
side of St. Paul&#8217;s, right against the clock.&#8221; Sir
Ambrose Heal, in <i>The London Furniture Makers</i>, illustrates
a superb japanned writing cabinet in green and
gold chinoiserie made by Belchier in 1730.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Belchier
also supplied Shalstone Manor, the Buckinghamshire
estate of Henry Purefoy, with a table-desk in 1749
(<a href="#Fig_13">fig. 13</a>).<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The ledger notes other occasional purchases of
furniture during this period. In 1746 Mercer paid
cash &#8220;for oysters &amp; a bedsteed,&#8221; in the amount of
10s. 6d. In September 1748, he bought &#8220;an Escritoire&#8221;
from tutor John Phipps, for which he paid £5.</p>


<p class="title">LIGHTING DEVICES</p>

<p>Artificial lighting for the manor house receives
sparse mention. The four candlesticks bought in 1744
for a penny each were probably of iron or tin for
kitchen use. Candlesticks purchased earlier probably
remained in use, sufficing for most illumination. It
is a modern misconception that colonial houses were
ablaze at night with lamplight and candlelight.
Candles were expensive to buy and time-consuming
to make, while lamps rarely were used before the
end of the century in the more refined areas of
households. The principal use of candles was in
guiding one&#8217;s way to bed or in providing the minimum
necessary light to carry on an evening&#8217;s conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
During cold weather, fireplaces were a satisfactory
supplement. In general, early to bed and early to
rise was the rule, as William Byrd has shown us, and
artificial light was only a minor necessity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some illumination was needed in the
halls and great rooms of colonial plantation houses,
especially when guests were present&mdash;as they usually
were. The three sconce glasses which Captain Lyndon
delivered to Mercer in 1748 were doubtless
elegant answers to this requirement. These glasses
were mirrors with one or more candle branches,
arranged so that the light would be reflected and
multiplied. On special occasions, these, and perhaps
some candelabra and a scattering of candlesticks to
supplement them, provided concentrations of light;
for such affairs the use of ordinary tallow candles,
with their drippings and smoke, was out of the
question. A pleasant alternative is indicated by the
purchase in April 1749 of &#8220;11&frac12; lib. Myrtle Wax
att 5d ... 14.4&frac12;&#8221; and &#8220;4 lib Beeswax 6/&#8221; from
Thomas Jones of the Eastern Shore. Similar purchases
also are recorded. Myrtle wax came from
what the Virginians called the myrtle bush, better
known today as the bayberry bush. Its gray berries
yielded a fragrant aromatic wax much favored in the
colonies. In making candles it was usually mixed
with beeswax, as was evidently the case here. A
clean-burning, superior light source, it was nonetheless
an expensive one. Burning in the brackets of the
sconce glasses at Marlborough, heightening the
shadows of the Palladian woodwork and, when
snuffed, emitting its faint but delicious fragrance,
it must have been a delight to the eyes and the
nostrils alike.</p>


<p class="title">NEGROES</p>

<p>Negroes played an increasingly important part in
the life of Marlborough, particularly after the manor
house was built. Between 1731 and 1750 Mercer
purchased 89 Negroes. Most of these are listed by
name in the ledger accounts. Forty-six died in this
period, while 25 were born, leaving a total of 66
Negroes on his staff in 1750. In 1746 he bought 6
men and 14 women at £21 10s. from Harmer &amp;
King in Williamsburg. The new house and the
expanded needs for service were perhaps the reasons
for this largest single purchase of slaves.</p>

<p>There is no indication that Mercer treated his
slaves other than well, or that they caused him any
serious difficulties. On the other hand, his frequent
reference to them by name, the recording of their
children&#8217;s names and birth dates in his ledger, and
the mention in his journal of new births among his
slave population all attest to an essentially paternalistic
attitude that was characteristic of most Virginia
planters during the 18th century. Good physical
care of the Negroes was motivated perhaps as much
by self-interest in protecting an investment as by
humane considerations, but, nonetheless, we find such
items in the ledger as &#8220;To Cash p<sup>d</sup> Doctor Lynn for
delivering Deborah.&#8221;</p>

<p>That discipline served for the Negroes as it usually
did for all colonials, whether the lawbreaker were
slave, bondsman, or free citizen, is indicated by an
entry in the Dick account: &#8220;2 thongs w<sup>th</sup> Silk lashes
1/3.&#8221; One must bear in mind that corporal punishment
was accepted universally in the 18th century.
Its application to slaves, however, usually was left to
the discretion of the slave owner, so that the restraint
with which it was administered depended largely
upon the humanity and wisdom of the master.</p>

<p>The use of the lash was more often than not
delegated to the overseer, who was hired to run, or
help run, the plantation. It was the overseer who
had a direct interest in eliciting production from the
field hands; a sadistic overseer, therefore, might
create a hell for the slaves under him. It is clear
from Mercer&#8217;s records that some of his overseers
caused problems for him and that at least one was
a brutal man. For October 1747 a chilling entry
appears in the account of William Graham, an overseer
at Bull Run Quarters: &#8220;To Negroes for one you
made hang himself. £35.&#8221; Entered in the &#8220;Negroes&#8221;
account, it reappears, somewhat differently: &#8220;To
William Graham for Frank (Hanged) £35 Sterling.
£50. 15.&#8221; This is one of several instances on record
of Negroes driven to suicide as the only alternative
to enduring cruelties.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In this case, Graham was
fined 50 shillings and 1293 pounds of tobacco.</p>

<p>We do not know, of course, whether other Negroes
listed as dead in Mercer&#8217;s account died of natural
causes or whether cruel treatment contributed to
their deaths. In the case of a homesick Negro named
Joe, who ran away for the third time in 1745, Mercer
seems reluctantly to have resorted to an offer of
reward and an appeal to the law. Even so, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
declined to place all the blame on Joe. Joe had
been &#8220;Coachman to Mr. Belfield of Richmond
County&#8221; and in the reward offer Mercer states that
Joe</p>

<blockquote><p>... was for some time after he first ran away lurking
about the Widow Belfield&#8217;s Plantation.... He is a
short, well-set Fellow, about 26 Years of Age, and took
with him several cloaths, among the rest a Suit of Blue,
lined and faced with Red, with White Metal Buttons,
Whoever will secure and bring home the said Negroe,
shall receive Two Pistoles Reward, besides what the
Law allows: And as I have a great Reason to believe,
that he is privately encouraged to run away, and then
harboured and concealed, so that the Person or Persons so
harbouring him may be thereof convicted, I will pay to
such Discoverer Ten Pistoles upon Conviction. This
being the third Trip he has made since I bought him in
<i>January</i> last, I desire he may receive such Correction in
his Way home as the Law directs, when apprehended.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whether Joe received the harsh punishment his
offense called for is not recorded. However, in 1748
Mercer accounted for cash paid for &#8220;Joe&#8217;s Lodging &amp;
burial £3. 10.,&#8221; suggesting that Joe enjoyed death-bed
care and a decent burial, even though he may
have succumbed to &#8220;such correction ... as the law
directs.&#8221;</p>

<p>As has already been suggested, his overseers seem
to have given Mercer more trouble than his slaves.
One was Booth Jones of Stafford, about whom Mercer
confided in his ledger, &#8220;By allowed him as Overseer
tho he ran away about 5 weeks before his time was
out by w<sup>ch</sup> I suffered more damage than his whole
wages. £3. 11.&#8221; Meanwhile, in 1746 William
Wheeland, an overseer at Bull Run Quarters,
&#8220;imbezilled&#8221; 40 barrels of corn.</p>

<p>James Savage was one of the principal overseers
and seems to have been in charge first at Sumner&#8217;s
Quarters and then at Bull Run Quarters. John
Ferguson succeeded him at the former place. William
Torbutt was also at Bull Run, while Mark Canton
and Nicholas Seward were overseers at Marlborough.</p>

<p>The outfitting of slaves with proper clothes, blankets,
and coats was an important matter. It called for such
purchases as 121 ells of &#8220;ozenbrigs&#8221; from Hunter in
1742. &#8220;Ozenbrigs&#8221; was a coarse cloth of a type made
originally in Oznabruck, Germany,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and was traditionally
the Negro field hand&#8217;s raiment. Many
purchases of indigo point to the dying of &#8220;Virginia&#8221;
cloth, woven either on the plantation or by the
weavers mentioned earlier. Presumably, shoes for
the Negroes were made at Marlborough, judging from
a purchase from Dick of 3&frac14; pounds of shoe thread.
The domestic servants were liveried, at least after the
mansion was occupied. William Thomson, a Fredericksburg
tailor, made &#8220;a Coat &amp; Breeches [for]
Bob, 11/.&#8221; Bob was apparently Mercer&#8217;s personal
manservant, who had served him since 1732. Thomson
also was paid £4 16s. 2d. for &#8220;Making Liveries.&#8221;
The listing of such materials as &#8220;scarlet duffel&#8221; and
&#8220;scarlet buttons&#8221; points to colorful outfitting of
slaves.</p>


<p class="title">SAILING, FISHING, HUNTING</p>

<p>Water transportation was essential to all the
planters, most of whom owned sloops. We have seen
that Mercer used a sloop for his earliest trading
activities before he settled at Marlborough, and it is
apparent that in the 1740&#8217;s either this same sloop or
another which may have replaced it still was operated
by him. Hauling tobacco to Cave&#8217;s warehouse,
picking up a barrel of rum in Norfolk or a load of
lumber on the Eastern Shore were vital to the success
of the plantation. To equip the sloop, 14 yards of
topsail, ship&#8217;s twine, and a barrel of tar were purchased
in 1747. Mercer had two Negroes named
&#8220;Captain&#8221; and &#8220;Boatswain,&#8221; and we may suppose
that they had charge of the vessel. Such an arrangement
would not have been unique, for many years
after this, in 1768, Mercer wrote that &#8220;a sloop of
M<sup>r</sup> Ritchie&#8217;s that came around from Rapp<sup>a</sup> for a
load of tobacco stopped at my landing; his negro
skipper brought me a letter from M<sup>r</sup> Mills....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>That there was considerable hunting at Marlborough
is borne out by repeated references to
powder, shot, gunpowder, and gunflints. Fishing
may have been carried on from the sloop and also in
trap-nets of the same sort still used in Potomac Creek
off the Marlborough Point shore. In 1742 purchases
were made of a 40-fathom seine and 3 perch lines,
and in 1744 of 75 fishhooks and 2 drumlines.</p>


<p class="title">BOOKS</p>

<p>In Ledger G, Mercer listed all the books of his
library before 1746. He then listed additions as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
occurred through 1750 (<a href="#Page_198">Appendix K</a>). This astonishing
catalog, disclosing one of the largest libraries in
Virginia at that time, reveals the catholicity of
Mercer&#8217;s tastes and the inquiring mind that lay
behind them. Included in the catalog are the titles
of perhaps the most important law library in the
colony.</p>

<p>The names of all sorts of books on husbandry and
agriculture are to be found in the list: &#8220;Practice of
farming,&#8221; &#8220;Houghton&#8217;s Husbandry,&#8221; &#8220;Monarchy of
the Bees,&#8221; &#8220;Flax,&#8221; &#8220;Grass,&#8221; and Evelyn&#8217;s &#8220;A Discourse
of Sallets.&#8221; Mercer&#8217;s interest in brewing,
which later was to launch a full-scale, if abortive,
commercial enterprise is reflected in &#8220;London
Brewer,&#8221; &#8220;Scott&#8217;s Distilling and Fermentation,&#8221;
&#8220;Hops,&#8221; and the &#8220;Hop Gardin,&#8221; while &#8220;The Craftsman,&#8221;
&#8220;Woollen Manufacture,&#8221; and &#8220;New Improvements&#8221;
indicate his concern with the efficiency of
other plantation activities.</p>

<p>He displayed an interest in nature and science
typical of an 18th-century man: &#8220;Bacon&#8217;s Natural
History,&#8221; &#8220;Gordon&#8217;s Cosmography,&#8221; &#8220;Gordon&#8217;s Geography,&#8221;
&#8220;Atkinson&#8217;s Epitome of Navigation,&#8221; &#8220;Ozamun&#8217;s
Mathematical Recreations,&#8221; &#8220;Keill&#8217;s Astronomy,&#8221;
and &#8220;Newton&#8217;s Opticks.&#8221; Two others were
&#8220;Baker&#8217;s Microscope&#8221; and &#8220;Description of the
Microscope &amp;c.&#8221; It may be significant that in 1747
Mercer bought three microscopes from one &#8220;Doctor
Spencer&#8221; of Fredericksburg, the books on the subject
and the instruments themselves possibly having been
intended for the education of the three boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;150 Prints of Ovid&#8217;s Metamorphosis&#8221; appears, in
addition to &#8220;Ovid&#8217;s Metamorphosis and 25 Sins,&#8221; for
which Mercer paid £8 6s. to William Parks in 1746.
&#8220;Catalog of Plants&#8221; and &#8220;Merian of Insects&#8221; are
other titles related to natural science.</p>

<p>Many books on history and biography are listed&mdash;for
example, &#8220;Life of Oliver Cromwell,&#8221; &#8220;Lives of
the Popes,&#8221; &#8220;Life of the Duke of Argyle,&#8221; &#8220;Hughes
History of Barbadoes,&#8221; &#8220;Catholick History,&#8221; &#8220;History
of Virginia,&#8221; &#8220;Dr. Holde&#8217;s History of China,&#8221; &#8220;The
English Acquisitions in Guinea,&#8221; &#8220;Purchas&#8217;s Pilgrimage.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are 25 titles under &#8220;Physick &amp; Surgery,&#8221;
reflecting the planter&#8217;s need to know the rudiments of
medical care for his slaves and family. Art, architecture,
and travel interested him also, and we find such
titles as &#8220;Noblemen&#8217;s Seats by Kip,&#8221; &#8220;Willis&#8217;s Survey
of the Cathedrals,&#8221; &#8220;8 Views of Scotland,&#8221; &#8220;Perrier&#8217;s
Statues,&#8221; &#8220;Pozzo&#8217;s Perspective,&#8221; &#8220;100 Views of
Brabant &amp; Flanders,&#8221; &#8220;History of Amphitheatres.&#8221;
There was but one title on music&mdash;&#8220;The Musical
Miscellany,&#8221; mentioned previously. &#8220;Report about
Silver Coins&#8221; was probably an English report on the
exchange rate of silver coinage in the various British
colonies.</p>

<p>Mercer kept abreast of English literature of his own
and preceding generations: &#8220;Swift&#8217;s Sermons,&#8221; the
&#8220;Spectator&#8221; and the &#8220;Tatler,&#8221; &#8220;Pope&#8217;s Works,&#8221;
&#8220;Turkish Spy,&#8221; &#8220;Tom Brown&#8217;s Letters from the
Dead to the Living,&#8221; &#8220;Pamela,&#8221; &#8220;David Simple,&#8221;
&#8220;Joseph Andrews,&#8221; &#8220;Shakespeare&#8217;s Plays,&#8221; &#8220;Ben
Jonson&#8217;s Works,&#8221; &#8220;Wycherley&#8217;s Plays,&#8221; &#8220;Prior&#8217;s
Works,&#8221; &#8220;Savage&#8217;s Poems,&#8221; &#8220;Cowley&#8217;s Works,&#8221;
and &#8220;Select Plays&#8221; (in 16 volumes), to mention but
a few. The classics are well represented&mdash;&#8220;Lauderdale&#8217;s
Virgil,&#8221; &#8220;Ovid&#8217;s Art of Love,&#8221; &#8220;Martial&#8221; (in
Greek), as well as a Greek grammar and a Greek
testament. There were the usual sermons and religious
books, along with such diverse subjects as
&#8220;Alian&#8217;s Tacticks of War,&#8221; &#8220;Weston&#8217;s Treatise of
Shorthand&#8221; and &#8220;Weston&#8217;s Shorthand Copybook,&#8221;
and &#8220;Greave&#8217;s Origin of Weights, &amp;c.&#8221; He subscribed
to the <i>London Magazine</i> and the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, and received regularly the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>While most of Mercer&#8217;s books were for intellectual
edification or factual reference, a few must have
served the purpose of sheer visual pleasure. Such
was Merian&#8217;s magnificent quarto volume of hand-colored
engraved plates of Surinam insects, with
descriptive texts in Dutch. The 18th-century gentleman&#8217;s
taste for the elegant, the &#8220;curious,&#8221; and the
aesthetically delightful were all satisfied in this
luxurious book, which would have been placed
appropriately on a table for the pleasure of Mercer&#8217;s
guests.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>


<p class="title">THE PETITION</p>

<p>Although overseeing the construction of his mansion,
buying the furniture for it, and assembling a splendid
library would have been sufficient to keep lesser men
busy, Mercer was absorbed in other activities as well.
On May 10, 1748, for example, he recorded in his
journal that he went &#8220;to Raceground by James
Taylor&#8217;s &amp; Wid<sup>o</sup> Taliaferro&#8217;s,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> traveling 50 miles
to do so. On December 13, 1748, he went &#8220;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Stafford Court &amp; home. Swore to the Commission
of the Peace,&#8221; thus becoming a justice of the peace
for Stafford County.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 14.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Archeological survey plan</span> superimposed over detail of 1691 plat, showing
southwest corner of town developed by Mercer. It can be seen that the mansion foundation
was in the area near the change of course &#8220;by the Gutt between Geo. Andrew&#8217;s &amp;
the Court house,&#8221; hence in the vicinity of the courthouse site.</span>
</div>

<p>In the meanwhile, years had gone by, and no action
had been taken on the suit in chancery brought in
the 1730&#8217;s to establish Savage&#8217;s survey of Marlborough
as the official one. During this time, Mercer had
continued to build on various lots other than those
he owned, &#8220;relying on the Lease and Consent of
[the feoffees], at the Expense of above Fifteen Hundred
Pounds, which Improvements would have saved
forty lots.&#8221; Finally, &#8220;judging the only effectual way
to secure his Title would be to procure an Act of
General Assembly for that purpose,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Mercer
applied to the Stafford court to purchase the county&#8217;s
interest in the town, to which the court agreed on
August 11, 1747, the price to be 10,000 pounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
tobacco. Since this transaction required legislative
approval, Mercer filed with the House of Burgesses
the petition which has served so often in these pages
to tell the history of Marlborough.</p>

<p>Mercer argued in the petition that the county had
nothing to lose&mdash;that it &#8220;had received satisfaction&#8221;
for at least 30 lots, some of which he might be obliged
to buy over again; that, considering the history of the
town, no one but himself would be likely to take up
any other lots, the last having been subscribed to in
1708; and that his purchase of the town would be not
to the county&#8217;s disadvantage but rather to his own
great expense. He was willing to accept an appraisal
from &#8220;any one impartial person of Credit&#8221; who
would say the town was worth more, and to pay
&#8220;any Consideration this worshipful House shall think
just.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed out that the two acres set aside for the
courthouse were excluded and that they &#8220;must revert
to the Heir of the former Proprietor, (who is now an
Infant).&#8221; He did not indicate in the petition that
he himself was the guardian of William Brent, infant
heir to the courthouse property. It is most significant,
therefore, that in asking for favorable action he added,
&#8220;except the two acres thereof, which were taken in
for a Courthouse, as aforesaid and which he is
willing to lay of as this worshipful House may think
most for the Benefit of Mr. William Brent, the Infant,
to whom the same belongs, <i>or to pay him double or
treble the worth of the said two acres, if the same is also
vested in your Petitioner</i>.&#8221; (Italics supplied.) Plainly,
Mercer had much at stake in obtaining title to the
courthouse land. This supports the hypothesis that
the Gregg survey of 1707 infringed on the courthouse
land, that Ballard&#8217;s lot 19 on the Gregg survey overlapped
it, and that Mercer&#8217;s first two houses, and now
his mansion, were partly on land that rightfully
belonged to his ward, William Brent. Mercer
apparently had so built over all the lower part of
Marlborough without regard to title of ownership,
and had so committed himself to occupancy of the
courthouse site, that he was now in the embarrassing
position of having to look after William Brent&#8217;s
interests when they were in conflict with his own.
Likely it is that he had depended too much on acceptance
of the still-unauthorized Savage survey to correct
the previous discrepancies by means of its extra row
of lots.</p>

<p>Still further indication that the courthouse land
was at issue is found in the proceedings that followed
the petition. In these, there are repeated references
to Mercer&#8217;s having been called upon to testify &#8220;as
the Guardian of William Brent.&#8221; Clearly, the
legislators were concerned with the effect the acceptance
of the petition would have on Brent&#8217;s interests.
If Mercer, as seems likely, was building his mansion
on the courthouse land, the burgesses had reason to
question him. In any case, the House resolved in the
affirmative &#8220;That the said Petition be rejected&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>This setback was only temporary, however. The
wider problems of Marlborough had at least been
brought to light, so that by the time the next fall
session was held Mercer&#8217;s 18-year-old suit to have
Savage&#8217;s designated the official survey finally was
acted upon:</p>

<p>&#8220;At a General Court held at the Court House in
Williamsburg the 12th October 1749&#8221; the John
Savage survey of 1731 was &#8220;Decreed &amp; Ordered&#8221;
to be &#8220;the only Survey&#8221; of Marlborough. The
problem of overlapping boundaries occasioned by the
conflicts between the first two surveys was solved
neatly. Mercer agreed to accept lots 1 through 9,
22 and 25, and 33, 34, 42, and 43, &#8220;instead of the
s<sup>d</sup> 17 lots so purchased.&#8221; The new lots extended up
the Potomac River shore, while the &#8220;s<sup>d</sup> 17 lots&#8221; were
those which he had originally purchased and had
built upon. Since he had &#8220;saved&#8221; these 17 lots by
building on them, according to the old laws for the
town, &#8220;it is further decreed &amp; ordered that the said
Town of Marlborough grant &amp; convey unto the s<sup>d</sup>
John Mercer in fee such &amp; so many other Lotts in the
said Town as shall include the Houses &amp; Improvm<sup>ts</sup>
made by the said John Mercer according to the Rate
of 400 square feet of Housing for each Lot so as the
Lots to be granted for any House of greater Dimensions
be contiguous &amp; are not separated from the
said House by any of the Streets of the said Town.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Thus, Mercer&#8217;s original titles to 17 lots were made
secure by substituting new lots for the disputed ones
he had occupied. This device enabled the feoffees to
sell back the original lots&mdash;at £182 per lot&mdash;with
new deeds drawn on the basis of the Savage survey.
The final provision that lots be contiguous when a
house larger than the minimum 400 square feet was
built on them, and that the house and lots should
not be separated by streets from each other, guaranteed
the integrity of the mansion and its surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
land. No mention was made here, or in subsequent
transfers, of the courthouse land. Presumably it was
conveniently forgotten, Mercer perhaps having duly
recompensed his ward.</p>


<p class="title">HEALTH AND MEDICINE</p>

<p>Three weeks before his petition was read in the
House, Mercer became ill. On October 26, 1748, he
noted in his journal, &#8220;Very ill obliged to keep my
bed.&#8221; This was almost his first sickness after years
of apparently robust health. Such indispositions as
he occasionally suffered had occurred, like this one, at
Williamsburg, where conviviality and rich food caused
many another colonial worthy to founder. In this
case, anxiety over the outcome of his petition may
have brought on or aggravated his ailment. In
any event, he stayed throughout the court session at
the home of Dr. Kenneth McKenzie, who treated
him. On November 3 he noted that he was &#8220;On
Recovery,&#8221; and two days later &#8220;went out to take the
air.&#8221; The following appears in his account with
Dr. McKenzie:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>From William Parks, on another occasion, he
bought &#8220;Rattlesnake root,&#8221; which was promoted
in 18th-century Virginia as a specific against the
gout, smallpox, and &#8220;Pleuritick and Peripneumonic
Fevers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Twice he bought "British oyl," a
favorite popular nostrum sold in tall, square bottles,
and on another occasion &#8220;2 bottles of Daffy&#8217;s Elixir.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
In 1749 he settled his account with George Gilmer,
apothecary of Williamsburg, for such things as oil
of cinnamon, Holloways&#8217; Citrate, &#8220;Aqua Linnaean,&#8221;
rhubarb, sago, &#8220;Sal. Volat.,&#8221; spirits of lavender,
and gum fragac. The final item in the account was
for April 22, 1750, for &#8220;a Vomit.&#8221; The induced
vomit, usually by a tartar emetic, was an accepted
cure for overindulgence and a host of supposed
ailments. That inveterate valetudinarian and amateur
physician, William Byrd, was in the habit of
&#8220;giving&#8221; vomits to his sick slaves.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>In November and December 1749 Mercer sustained
his first long illness, during which he was
attended by &#8220;Doctor Amson.&#8221; &#8220;Taken sick&#8221; at
home on November 13, he evidently did not begin to
recover until December 11. Whatever improvement
he may have made must have received a setback on
the last day of the year, when he recorded in his
journal: &#8220;Took about 60 grains of Opium &amp; 60
grains of Euphorbium by mistake instead of a dose of
rhubarb.&#8221;</p>


<p class="title">RELIGION AND CHARITIES</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s religious observances were irregular,
although usually when he was home he attended
Potomac Church. At the same time he continued as
a vestryman in Overwharton Parish (which included
Potomac and Aquia churches). On September 28,
1745, the vestry met to decide whether to build a
new Aquia church or to repair the old one. They
&#8220;then proceeded to agree with one <i>William Walker</i>,
an Undertaker to build a new brick Church, Sixty
Feet Square in the Clear, for One Hundred and
Fifty Three Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty
Pounds of Transfer Tobacco.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In October Mercer
entered in Ledger G, under the Overwharton Parish
account, &#8220;To drawing articles with Walker.&#8221; In
December he charged the parish with &#8220;2 bottles
claret&#8221; and &#8220;To Robert Jackson for mending the
Church Plate.&#8221; Jackson was a Fredericksburg
silversmith.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The following March, the proprietors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Accokeek Ironworks petitioned the Committee on
Propositions and Grievances with an objection to the
vestry&#8217;s decision to rebuild, claiming that &#8220;as the
said Iron-Works lie in the Parish aforesaid, and employ
many Tithables in carrying on the same, they
will labour under great Hardships thereby....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The petition was rejected, but nothing seems to have
been done on the new church until three months
after Walker&#8217;s death in February 1750, when Mourning
Richards was appointed undertaker.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s charities in this decade form a short list.
His only outright gift was his &#8220;Subscription to
Protestant working-Schools in Ireland. To my
annual Subscription for Sterling £5.5.&#8221; In 1749 he
did £12 3s. worth of legal work for the College of
William and Mary, which he converted into &#8220;Subscriptions
to Schools&#8221; of equal value; in other words,
he donated his services.</p>


<p class="title">CATHERINE MERCER&#8217;S DEATH AND
ANN ROY&#8217;S ARRIVAL</p>

<p>On April 1, 1750, Mercer went to Williamsburg for
the spring session and stopped en route to visit his
friend Dr. Mungo Roy at Port Royal in Caroline
County. He remained at Williamsburg until the
seventh, except for going on the previous day to
&#8220;Greenspring&#8221; to be entertained by Philip Ludwell
in the Jacobean mansion built a century earlier by
Governor Berkeley. Again stopping off at Port
Royal, he returned home on May 10. He remained
there until June 15, when he made the laconic entry
in his journal: &#8220;My wife died between 3 &amp; 4 at noon.&#8221;
What time this denotes is unclear.</p>

</div>

<p>Following this loss&mdash;Catherine Mercer was only
43&mdash;Mercer remained at home for five days, then
visited his sister-in-law Mrs. Ann Mason. The next
night he stayed with the pastor of Aquia Church,
Mr. Moncure, then returned to Marlborough and
remained there for nearly a month. Meanwhile, he
purchased from Fielding Lewis, at a cost of
£3 18s. 7&frac12;d., &#8220;sundrys for mourning.&#8221; William
Thomson, the Stafford tailor, made his mourning
clothes. The preparations for the funeral must have
been elaborate; it was not held until July 13.</p>

<p>At the end of July Mercer went to Williamsburg,
thence to Yorktown, and from there to Hampton and
Norfolk by water on an &#8220;Antigua Ship,&#8221; returning
to Hampton on August 5 on a &#8220;Negro Ship,&#8221; evidently
having caught passage on oceangoing traders.
The younger children remained in Williamsburg with
George and a nurse. On September 8 he went to
Port Royal and stayed &#8220;at Dr. Roy&#8217;s.&#8221; He returned
home on the 10th, then went back to Port Royal on
the 14th, staying at Dr. Roy&#8217;s until the 20th, attending
Sunday church services during his visit. He returned
home again on the 23rd, only to visit Dr. Roy once
more on the 28th. The October court session drew
him to Williamsburg, where he remained until
November 7. While there, he purchased the following
from James Craig,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> a jeweler:</p>

<p>The period for mourning poor Catherine was short
indeed. But the mansion at Marlborough needed a
mistress, and Mercer&#8217;s children, a mother. A new
chapter was about to open as the decade closed.
From the meticulous records that Mercer kept, it has
been possible to see Mercer as a dynamic cosmopolite,
accomplishing an incredible amount in a few short
years. His constant physical movement from place to
place, his reading of the law and of even a fraction of
his hundreds of books in science, literature, and the
arts, his managing of four plantations, attending two
monthly court sessions a year at Williamsburg, looking
after the legal affairs of hundreds of clients, concerning
himself with the design and construction of a
remarkable house and selecting the furnishings for
it&mdash;all this illustrates a personality of enormous
capacity.</p>

<p>Marlborough was now a full-fledged plantation.
Although the legacy of an earlier age still nagged at
Mercer and prevented him from holding title to much
of the old town, he had, nevertheless, transformed it,
gracing it with the outspread grandeur of a Palladian
great house.</p>

<i>Mercer and Marlborough,
from
Zenith to Decline, 1751-1768</i></h3>


<p class="title">THE OHIO COMPANY</p>

<p>The long last period of Mercer&#8217;s life and of the
plantation he created began at a time of growing
concern about the western frontier and the wilderness
beyond it. In 1747 this concern had been
expressed in the founding of the Ohio Company of
Virginia by a group of notable colonial leaders:
Thomas Cresap, Augustine Washington, George
Fairfax, Lawrence Washington, Francis Thornton,
and Nathaniel Chapman. George Mason was an
early member, and so, not surprisingly, was John
Mercer, whose prestige as a lawyer was the primary
reason for his introduction to the company. We learn
from the minutes of the meeting on December 3, 1750.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;[Resolved] That it is absolutely necessary to have
proper Articles to bind the Company that Mason ...,
Scott &amp; Chapman or any two of them, apply to John
Mercer to consider and draw such Articles and desire
him attend the next general meeting of the Company at
Stafford Courthouse....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the meeting in May 1751, Mercer presented the
Articles and was &#8220;admitted as a Partner on advancing
his twentieth part of the whole Expence.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> From
then on he was virtually secretary of the company,
as well as its chief driving force. He was made a
committee member with Lawrence Washington,
Nathaniel Chapman, James Scott, and George Mason,
who was treasurer. The &#8220;Committee&#8221; was the central
or executive board.</p>

<p>With the leading members living in Stafford County
or nearby, most of the meetings of both the company
and the committee were held at Stafford courthouse,
and occasionally in private houses of the members.
We can imagine with what pride Mercer noted in his
journal for February 5-7, 1753, &#8220;Ohio Committee
met at my house.&#8221; The important role played by
the Ohio Company in the Mercers&#8217; lives&mdash;and by
them in the Company&mdash;is fully recounted in the
<i>George Mercer Papers Relating to the Ohio Company of
Virginia</i>.</p>


<p class="title">GEORGE, JOHN, AND JAMES</p>

<p>Mercer doubtless threw himself into the Ohio
Company&#8217;s affairs with characteristic drive and
enthusiasm. We may surmise that there was heady
talk at Marlborough about the frontier and of
dangerous exploits against the Indians and the
French&mdash;enough, at least, to have stirred youthful
cravings for adventure among the Mercer boys.
Certain it is that George and John Fenton, aged 19
and 18, respectively, joined the frontier regiment of
their neighbor Colonel Fry as young officers &#8220;upon
the first incursions of the French.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>James, aged 16 and too young for soldiering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
exhibited an unusual aptitude for architecture. His
talent was noticed by William Bromley, the master
joiner on the mansion house, who told Mercer that
James &#8220;had a most extraordinary turn to mechanicks.&#8221;
On the strength of this, Mercer decided
that James should become a master carpenter or
joiner, then synonymous with &#8220;architect.&#8221; In
America in 1753 professional architects, as we know
them, did not exist; gentlemen, some very talented,
designed and drafted, while skilled joiners or carpenters
followed general directions, executing, engineering,
and inventing as they went along.</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s decision was as unconventional as it was
prescient, being made at a time when gentlemen were
not expected to learn a trade, yet at a moment when
the respected place the professional architect was
later to have could be envisioned. Indeed, he
explained his feeling that those who possessed architectural
skills &#8220;were more beneficial members of
society, and more likely to make a fortune, with credit,
than the young Gentlemen of those times, who wore
laced jackets attended for improvement at ordinaries,
horse races, cock matches, and gaming tables.&#8221;
Motivated by this honest sense of values, forged in the
experience of a self-made man, Mercer proceeded to
bind James &#8220;apprentice to Mr. Waite, a master
carpenter and undertaker (of Alexandria), who
covenanted to instruct him in all the different branches
of that business. At the same time I bound four
young Negro fellows (which I had given him) to Mr.
Waite, who covenanted to instruct each of them in a
particular branch. These, I expected, when they
were out of their time, would place him in such a
situation as might enable him to provide for himself,
if I should not be able to do any more for him. It is
notorious that I received the compliments of the
Governour, several of the Council, and many of the
best Gentlemen in the country, for having set such an
example, which, they said, they hoped would banish
that false pride that too many of their countrymen
were actuated by.&#8221;</p>

<p>On June 25, 1753, Mercer noted in his journal,
&#8220;At home. Bound son James &amp; Peter &amp; Essex to
W<sup>m</sup> Waite for 5 y<sup>rs</sup>.&#8221; However commendable this
effort to banish &#8220;false pride&#8221; may have been, it was
probably not a realistic solution for James&#8217; career.
James, as we shall see, was to make his own choice
later and was to follow with great distinction in his
father&#8217;s footsteps as a lawyer.</p>


<p class="title">GROWING BURDENS,
RESPONSIBILITIES, AND DEBTS</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mercer had announced his intention to
publish a new edition of the <i>Abridgment</i>. In doing so,
he adopted a hostile, testy approach that was unusual
even in 18th-century advertising. Implying that he
was doing a favor to an ungrateful populace, he stated
in the Virginia <i>Gazette</i> on August 16, 1751, &#8220;I have
been prevail&#8217;d upon to print it, if I have a prospect of
saving myself, though the Treatment I met from the
Subscribers to the last had determined me never to be
again concerned in an Undertaking of this Kind.&#8221;
On the following February 20, he announced in the
<i>Gazette</i> that if there were 600 subscribers by the last of
the next General Court he would send the copy to
press. If not, he would return the money to those who
had subscribed, &#8220;which I should not have troubled
myself with, if I could have thought of any other
Expedient to secure myself against the base Usage I
met with from the Subscribers to my former <i>Abridgment</i>,
who left above 1200 of them on my Hands.&#8221;
This kind of advertising had its predictable response:
publication of the new <i>Abridgment</i> was postponed
indefinitely.</p>

<p>The first suggestion that all was not well in Mercer&#8217;s
financial affairs was given in an advertisement in the
<i>Gazette</i> on April 10, 1752. In this he noted that he
had agreed to pay the debts of one Francis Wroughton,
a London merchant, out of Wroughton&#8217;s effects.
However, although Wroughton&#8217;s effects had not
materialized, he promised to make payment anyway,
&#8220;notwithstanding a large Ballance due to myself.&#8221;
He concluded, &#8220;Besides Mr. <i>Wroughton&#8217;s</i> Debts, I
have some of my own (and not inconsiderable) to
pay, therefore I hope that such Gentlemen as are
indebted to me will, without putting me to the
Blush which a Dunn will occasion, discharge their
Debts....&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps to alleviate these difficulties, he had
advertised in the Gazette on the previous March 15
that he would lease &#8220;3,000 Acres of extraordinary
good fresh Land, in Fairfax and Prince William,&#8221;
but there is no evidence that he was successful.</p>

<p>Signs of irritability became increasingly noticeable.
In 1753 he outraged his fellow justices at Stafford
court&mdash;so much so that they brought charges against
him before the Executive Council &#8220;for misbehavior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as a Justice.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It was decided that, although
&#8220;his Conduct had been in some Respects blameable,
particularly by his Intemperance, opprobrious Language
on the Bench, and indecent Treatment of the
other Justices, ... that in Consideration of his
having been a principal Instrument in a due Administration
of Justice, and expediting the Business of
the County, it has been thought proper to continue
him Judge of the Court.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>A growing burden of debt, in contrast to the
prosperity of the preceding decade, clearly affected
Mercer&#8217;s attitude, as we can see in a Gazette advertisement
on November 7, 1754: &#8220;I will not undertake
any new, or finish any old Cause, &#8217;til I receive
my Fee, or Security for it to my liking: And I hope
such Gentlemen as for above these seven years past
have put me off with Promises every succeeding
General Court will think it reasonable now to discharge
their accounts.&#8221; Concurrent with indebtedness
was an almost annual increase in the size of
his family. In 1752 Grace Fenton Mercer was born,
the next year Mungo Roy, and in 1754 Elinor.</p>

<p>At the same time, he still pursued the restless
activity that characterized his earlier years. On
July 24, 1753, Mercer went &#8220;to Balthrop&#8217;s, Smith&#8217;s
Ordin<sup>ry</sup> &amp; Vaulx&#8217;s,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> a distance of 27 miles, during
which he &#8220;Overset.&#8221; On the 25th he went on eight
miles farther &#8220;to Col<sup>o</sup> Phil Lee&#8217;s&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> for a three-day
meeting of the Ohio Company, then went the whole
35 miles home on the 28th. On September 6 he was
called eight miles away &#8220;to Boyd&#8217;s hole on Inquest as
Coroner &amp; home by 4 in the morn<sup>g</sup>,&#8221; while the next
day he was &#8220;at home. Son Mungo Roy born ab<sup>t</sup> 2
in the morning.&#8221; On the 19th Mungo Roy was
christened. Four days later he went 15 miles to
Fredericksburg for the christening of William Dick&#8217;s
son Alexander, returning home the next day. The
following day Mercer journeyed 14 miles and back to
&#8220;Holdbrook&#8217;s Survey&#8221; by way of Mountjoy&#8217;s, and
repeated the trip the next day, stopping at Major
Hedgman&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> coming and going. On October 5
he made a three-day trip to Williamsburg, covering
the distance in stretches of 16, 52, and 42 miles per
day, respectively. He went by way of Port Royal,
where he &#8220;Met M<sup>r</sup> Wroughton,&#8221; presumably the
London merchant whose creditors he had agreed to
pay. The second day took him by way of King
William courthouse. On the return on November
4-6, he came via Chiswell&#8217;s Ordinary<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and New
Kent courthouse (which he noted had "Burnt"),
covering a total of 110 miles.</p>

<p>On June 3, 1754, his clerk reported to duty,
according to a journal entry: &#8220;Rogers came here at
£50 p<sup>r</sup> annum.&#8221; Rogers remained in Mercer&#8217;s employ
until 1768.</p>

<p>Mercer seems to have been driving himself to the
limit, not to achieve success as in the prior decades,
but rather to hold secure what he already had.
The specter of debt now hung over him, as it did over
nearly every planter, under the increasing burdens of
the French and Indian War. The 17th-century
wisdom of William Fitzhugh and Robert Beverley in
seeking to lead the colony away from complete
dependence upon tobacco was apparent to those who
would remember. Marlborough, although still technically
a town, was now in reality a tobacco plantation,
and Mercer, despite his status as a lawyer, was
as irretrievably committed to the success or failure
of tobacco as was Fitzhugh 70 years earlier. The
hard years were now upon all, and, like his equally
hard-pressed debtors, Mercer was suffering from
them.</p>


<p class="title">LIFE AT MARLBOROUGH
DURING THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WARS</p>

<p>On March 11, 1755, after nearly 30 years of uncertainty
about his titles to Marlborough, Mercer at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
was granted the entire 52-acre town in a release from
the feoffees, Peter Daniel and Gerard Fowke. This
was made with the provision that he should be &#8220;Eased
from making improvements on the other twenty-six
Lots (those not built upon), to prevent their forfeiture
and the County will be wholly reimbursed, which it is
not probable it ever will be otherwise as only one Lot
has been taken up in forty-seven years last past and
there is not one House in the said town which has not
been built by the said Mercer.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>While the day-to-day events of Marlborough went
on much as ever, the conflict between the British and
the French spread from Canada southward along the
western ridge of the Appalachians. This expansion,
inevitably, was reflected in the Mercers&#8217; activities in
many ways, both great and small. As the struggle
approached its climax, Braddock&#8217;s troops came to
Virginia in March 1755, and were quartered in
Alexandria. Among them was John Mercer&#8217;s brother,
Captain James Mercer, who was a professional soldier.
On March 25 John left Marlborough for Alexandria,
probably to greet James and to have him billeted at
William Waite&#8217;s house where young son James already
was living as Waite&#8217;s apprentice. This bringing
together of two far-flung members of the Mercer
family had unanticipated results. Captain James was
a British gentlemen-officer, untouched by the leveling
influences of colonial life and therefore untempted to
banish &#8220;false pride&#8221; by any such radical means as
John had employed with young James. Indeed, the
sight of his nephew learning a mechanical trade must
have been a rude shock, for we learn from John
Mercer that Captain James &#8220;found means to make
his nephew uneasy under his choice; and I was from
that time incessantly teazed, by those who well knew
their interest over me, until I was brought to consent
very reluctantly that he should quit the plumb and
square&#8221; and become a lawyer.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Mercer returned to Marlborough by way of
George Mason&#8217;s, near the place where a few months
later William Buckland was to begin work on
&#8220;Gunston Hall.&#8221; He remained there all day on
April 1&mdash;&#8220;at M<sup>r</sup> Mason&#8217;s wind bound,&#8221; he wrote in
his journal. The next day he went &#8220;home through a
very great gust.&#8221;</p>

<p>The problems of managing a plantation went on
through peace and through war. Besides a multitude
of Negroes, there were also indentured white
servants at Marlborough. One of these ran away
and was advertised in the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> on May 2,
1755:</p>

<blockquote><p>... a Servant Man named <i>John Clark</i>, he pretends
sometimes to be a Ship-Carpenter by Trade, at other
Times a Sawyer or a Founder ... he is about 5 feet
7 inches high, round Shoulders, a dark Complexion,
grey eyes, a large Nose and thick Lips, an <i>Englishman</i> by
birth; had on when he went away, a blue Duffil Frock
with flat white Metal Buttons and round Cuffs, red
corded Plush Breeches, old grey Worsted Stockings, old
Shoes, and broad Pewter Buckles, brown Linen wide
Trousers, some check&#8217;d Shirts, and a Muslin Neckcloth;
had also an old Beaver Hat bound round with Linen.</p></blockquote>

<p>On October 24, the <i>Gazette</i> carried another advertisement
related to Mercer&#8217;s problems of personnel:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Miller that understands the Management of a Wind-mill,
and can procure a proper Recommendation, may
have good Wages, on applying to the Subscriber during
the General Court, at <i>Williamsburg</i>, or afterwards, at his
House in <i>Stafford</i> County, before the last Day of November,
or if any such Person will enclose his Recommendation,
and let me know his Terms by the Post from
<i>Williamsburg</i>, he may depend on meeting an Answer at
the Post-Office there, without Charge, the first Post after
his Letter comes to my Hands. <i>John Mercer</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In the meanwhile, the war had broken out in full
scale, and the disaster at Fort Duquesne had taken
place. Mercer apparently learned the bad news at
a Stafford court session, for he noted in his journal
on July 9, after observing his attendance at court,
&#8220;General Braddock defeated.&#8221; We can imagine
his concern, for both George and John Fenton were
participants in the campaign.</p>

<p>On April 18, 1756, John Fenton was killed in
action while fighting under Washington.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Curiously,
his death was not mentioned in the journal. Instead,
we learn of the death of John Mercer&#8217;s horse on the
way to Williamsburg in April and of the fact that,
on his return in May, Mercer lost his way and
traveled 46 miles in a day. He tells us that he went
&#8220;to M<sup>r</sup> Moncure&#8217;s by water&#8221; on May 26, a distance
of 15 miles, and that he made a round trip from
Mr. Moncure&#8217;s to Aquia Church for a total of 12
miles. On July 14, he noted that he went &#8220;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Maj<sup>r</sup> Hedgman&#8217;s &amp; returning thrown out of the
chaise &amp; very much bruised.&#8221;</p>

<p>The demands of the war are revealed in journal
entries made in June 1757. On the 20th he wrote,
&#8220;to Court to prick Soldiers &amp; home,&#8221; and on the
27th, &#8220;to Court to draft Soldiers &amp; home.&#8221; As at
other times in the journal, birth and death, in their
tragic immediacy and repetitiveness, were juxtaposed
in September: on the 24th, &#8220;Son John born&#8221;; on
the 27th, &#8220;Brother James died at Albany&#8221;; on the
28th, &#8220;Son John died.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1758 George Mason ran for the office of burgess
from both Stafford and Fairfax. On July 11,
Mercer went to the Stafford elections, where &#8220;Lee &amp;
Mason&#8221; were chosen. On the 15th, he went &#8220;to
M<sup>r</sup> Selden&#8217;s &amp; home by water to see M<sup>r</sup> Mason,&#8221;
who evidently had come to Marlborough for a visit.
Four days later, he traveled to Alexandria for the
elections there and saw &#8220;Johnston &amp; Mason&#8221;
elected.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1758 he went, as usual, to Williamsburg.
His route this time was long and devious,
taking him to both Caroline and King William
County courthouses on the way, for a total of 121
miles in five days. We learn of one of the hazards
of protracted journeys in the 18th century from a
notation repeated daily in his journal for four days
following his arrival: &#8220;at Williamsburg Confined to
Bed with the Piles.&#8221;</p>

<p>On November 15, soon after his return to Marlborough,
Mercer was sworn to the new commission
of Stafford justices. Five days previously his son
Catesby had been buried, but, as usually happened,
new life came to take the place of that which had
survived so briefly. On May 17, 1759, Mercer
recorded, &#8220;Son John Francis born at 7 in the Evening.&#8221;
John Francis evidently was given an auspicious start
in life by a christening of more than ordinary formality:
&#8220;May 28. to Col<sup>o</sup> Harrison&#8217;s with the Gov<sup>r</sup> Son
christened.&#8221;</p>

<p>During 1759 the second edition of the <i>Abridgment</i>
was published in Glasgow, Scotland, this time with
neither public notice nor recrimination.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> On November
25, Mercer met the growing problem of his
indebtedness by deeding equal shares of some of his
properties, as well as whole amounts of others, to
George and James Mercer, Marlborough and a few
other small holdings excepted. Fifty Negroes were
included in the transaction. This action was followed
immediately by the release of the properties under
their new titles to Colonel John Tayloe and Colonel
Presley Thornton for a year, thus providing cash by
which George and James could pay £3000 of John
Mercer&#8217;s debts.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The Ohio Company was experiencing its difficulties
also. Mercer&#8217;s importance in it was demonstrated by
his appointment to &#8220;draw up a full State of the
Company&#8217;s Case setting forth the Hardships We
labour under and the Reasons why the Lands have
not been settled and the Fort finished according to
Royal Instructions....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This was his most
responsible assignment during his activity in the
company.</p>

<p>Indebtedness throughout these years lurked constantly
in the background, now and then breaking
through acutely. In 1760, for example, William
Tooke, a London merchant, brought suit to collect
£331 1s. 6d. which Mercer owed him. Two years
later Capel Hanbury sued Mercer for £31 10s.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>In 1761 George Washington and George Mercer
ran for burgesses from Frederick County in the
Shenandoah Valley, and both were elected. John
Mercer, evidently anxious to be present for the election,
undertook the arduous journey to Winchester,
leaving Marlborough on May 15. His itinerary was
as follows:</p>

<p>In the previous year Anna had been born, and
now, on December 14, 1761, Maria arrived. Between
the 8th and the 20th of August, 1762, entries
were made that suggest that there was an epidemic
of sorts at Marlborough: &#8220;Cupid died // Tom
(Poll&#8217;s) died // Daughter Elinor died // Miss B. Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
died.&#8221; In his long letter to George, written in
1768, he reflected on the fact that, although through
the years 98 Negroes had been born at Marlborough,
he, at that time, had fewer than the total of all he
had ever bought. &#8220;Your sister Selden,&#8221; he wrote
&#8220;attributes it to the unhealthiness of Patomack
Neck, which there may be something in.... I
thank God, however, that my own family has been
generally as healthy as other people&#8217;s.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>


<p class="title">THE END OF THE WAR
AND THE STAMP ACT</p>

<p>The year 1763 marked the end of the war. It also
signaled a turning point in the colonies&#8217; relations with
England. In a royal proclamation the King prohibited
the colonies from expanding westward past
the Appalachian ridge, in effect nullifying the Ohio
Company&#8217;s claims and objectives. George Mercer
was appointed agent of the company and was dispatched
to England to plead its cause.</p>

<p>By this time Britain was beginning to apply the
other allegedly oppressive measures which preceded
the Revolution. Antismuggling laws were enforced,
implemented by &#8220;writs of assistance,&#8221; thus increasing
colonial burdens which had been avoided previously
by widespread smuggling. The South was particularly
hard hit by parliamentary orders forbidding the
colonies the use of paper money as legal tender for
payment of debts. In a part of the world where a
credit economy and chronic indebtedness made a
flexible currency essential, this measure was a
disastrous matter.</p>

<p>Despite the ominousness of the times, Mercer continued
with the daily routine, the minutiae of which
filled his journal. He noted on January 9, 1763, that
he went to Potomac Church&mdash;&#8220;Neither Minister or
clerk there.&#8221; On February 21 he went a mile&mdash;probably
up Potomac Creek&mdash;to watch &#8220;John
Waugh&#8217;s halling the Saine &amp; home.&#8221; On March 1
his merchant friend John Champe was buried. After
the funeral Mercer went directly to Selden&#8217;s for an
Ohio Company meeting.</p>

<p>From December 10 until March 1765, Mercer was
sick. Of this interval, he wrote George in 1768 that
&#8220;My business had latterly so much encreased,
together with my slowness in writing, &amp; Rogers, tho
a tolerable good clerk, was so incapable of assisting
me out of the common road, that when you saw me at
Williamsburg, I was reduced by my fatigue, to a very
valetudinary state.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Indebtedness, overwork, advancing
age, and the reverses of the times had
evidently caused a crisis.</p>

<p>Passage of the Stamp Act in 1765, to raise revenues
to support an army of occupation in the colonies,
struck close to John Mercer, for George, while in
England, had been designated stamp officer for
Virginia. George returned to Williamsburg, little
expecting the hostile greeting he was to receive from
a crowd of angry planters. Quickly disavowing his
new office, he returned the stamps the following day.</p>

<p>Many made the most of George&#8217;s tactical blunder
in accepting the stamp-officer appointment. Indeed,
the Mercers seem to have been made the scapegoats
for the frustrations and turmoil into which the
mother country&#8217;s actions had plunged the colony.
George Mercer was hanged in effigy at Westmoreland
courthouse, and James Mercer took to the <i>Gazettes</i>
to defend him. There were counterattacks on James
while he was absent in Frederick County, and
Mercer himself rushed in with a lengthy satirical
diatribe entitled &#8220;Prophecy from the East.&#8221; Occupying
all the space normally devoted to foreign
news in Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> for September
26, 1766, this struck out at anonymous
attackers whom Mercer scathingly nicknamed Gibbet,
Scandal, Pillory, and Clysterpipe. He later explained
to George that James&#8217; &#8220;antagonist was backed by
so many anonymous scoundrels, that I was drawn
in during his abscence at the springs in Frederick
to answer I did not know whom tho it since appears
D<sup>r</sup> Arthur Lee was the principal, if not the only
assassin under different vizors, &amp; he was so regardless
of truth that he invented &amp; published the most
infamous lies as indisputable facts: on your brother&#8217;s
return I got out of the scrape but from a paper war
it turned to a challenge, which produced a skirmish,
in which your bro. without receiving any damage
broke the Doctors head, &amp; closed his eyes in
such a manner as obliged him to keep his house
sometime....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Of John Mercer&#8217;s own attitude towards the Stamp
Act there can be no question. On November 1,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
1765, he noted in his journal, &#8220;The damned Stamp
Act was to have taken place this day but was proved
initially disappointed.&#8221; He is said to have written
a tract against the Stamp Act, although no copy
has survived.</p>


<p class="title">THE CLOSING YEARS<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The elements of tragedy mark Mercer&#8217;s final
years&mdash;the tragedy of John Mercer and Marlborough
interwoven with the epic failures of the colonial
experiment. Prompted by his illness, he quit his
legal practice in the courts in 1765. In the same
year he &#8220;gave notice to the members of the Ohio
Company, that my health &amp; business would not
longer allow me to concern myself in their affairs
which they had entirely flung upon my hands.&#8221;
He also &#8220;on account of my deafness, refused to act as
a justice, which I should not have done otherwise, as
I have the satisfaction to know that I have done
my country some service in this station.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavily in debt, disillusioned and embittered by the
dwindling results of his struggles, he wrote that &#8220;I
have attended the bar thirty-six years, through a
perpetual hurry and uneasiness, and have been more
truly a slave than any one I am, or ever was, master
of; yet have not been able, since the first day of last
January, to command ten pounds, out of near ten
thousand due me.&#8221; Recoiling from his situation, he
desperately sought a way out and a means to recover
his losses. With self-deceptive optimism he seized
upon the idea of establishing a brewery at Marlborough,
since &#8220;our Ordinaries abound &amp; daily
increase (for drinking will continue longer than
anything but eating).&#8221; Accordingly, he built a
brewhouse and a malthouse, each 100 feet long, of
brick and stone, together with &#8220;Cellars, Cooper&#8217;s
house &amp; all the buildings, copper &amp; utensils whatever,
used about the brewery.&#8221; He depended at
first on his windmill for grinding the malt, but to
avoid delays on windless days, &#8220;I have now a hand-mill
fixed in my brewhouse loft that will grind 50
bushels of malt (my coppers complement) every
morning they brew.&#8221;</p>

<p>To get his project under way, Mercer plunged
further into the depths of debt by buying 40 Negroes
&#8220;to enable me to make Grain sufficient to carry on
my brewery with my own hands.&#8221; These cost £8000,
&#8220;a large part of which was unpaid, for payment of
which I depended on the Brewery itself &amp; the great
number of Debts due to me.&#8221; But the external fate
which was driving him closer and closer to destruction
now struck with the death of John Robinson, treasurer
of the colony, who, having lent public funds promiscuously
to debtor friends, had left a deficiency of
£100,000 in the colonial treasury. A chain reaction
of suits developed, threatening James Hunter of
Fredericksburg, Mercer&#8217;s security for purchase of the
slaves.</p>

<p>The brewery lumbered and stumbled. Mercer&#8217;s
first brewer, a young Scot named Wales, prevailed
upon him to spend £100 to alter the new malthouse.
On September 16, 1765, William King, evidently
a master brewer, arrived. He immediately found
fault with Wales&#8217; changes in the malthouse. Within
three weeks, however, King died. King&#8217;s nephew,
named Bailey, then came unannounced with a high
recommendation as a brewer from a man he had
served only as a gardener. Mercer was impressed:
&#8220;You may readily believe I did not hesitate to
employ Bailey on such a recommendation, more
especially as he agreed with King in blaming the
alteration of the malt house &amp; besides found great
fault with Wales&#8217;s malting.&#8221; Faced with rival claims
as to which could brew better beer, Mercer allowed
each to brew separately. &#8220;Yet though Bailey found
as much fault with Wales&#8217;s brewing as he did with his
malting, that brewed by Wales was the only beer I
had that Season fit to drink.&#8221; Wales, however,
brewed only £40 worth of beer, barely enough to pay
his wages, let alone maintenance for himself and his
wife. Although Bailey brewed enough to send a
schooner load of it to Norfolk, it was of such &#8220;bad
character&#8221; that only two casks were sold, the remainder
having been stored with charges for two months,
then brought back to Marlborough, where an effort
to distill it failed.</p>

<p>In 1766 there was a similar tale. Five hundred fifty
bushels of malt were produced, but much of the beer
and ale was bad. In January 1766, Andrew Monroe<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
was employed as overseer. &#8220;Wales complains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of my Overseer &amp; says that he is obliged to wait
for barley, coals &amp; other things that are wanted which,
if timely supplied with he could with six men &amp; a
boy manufacture 250 bushels a week which would
clear £200.... My Overseer is a very good one &amp;
I believe as a planter equal to any in Virginia but you
are sensible few planters are good farmers and barley
is a farmer&#8217;s article,&#8221; Mercer wrote to George.
Besides the overhead of slaves and nonproductive
brewers, the establishment required the services of
two coopers at £20 per year.</p>

<p>Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> for April 10, 1766,
carried the advertisement of Mercer&#8217;s brewery:</p>

<blockquote><p>To be SOLD, at the
MARLBOROUGH BREWERY</p>

<p>STRONG BEER AND PORTER at 18d. and ALE at
1s. the gallon, <i>Virginia</i> currency, in cask, equal in goodness
to any that can be imported from any part of the
world, as nothing but the genuine best MALT and
HOPS will be used, without any mixture or substitute
whatsoever; which, if the many treaties of brewing
published in <i>Great Britain</i> did not mention to be frequently
used there, the experience of those who have
drunk those liquors imported from thence would point
out to be the case, from their pernicious effects.</p>

<p>The severe treatment we have lately received from our
Mother Country, would, I should think, be sufficient to
recommend my undertaking (though I should not be
able to come up to the English standard, which I do not
question constantly to do) yet, as I am satisfied that the
goodness of every commodity is its best recommendation,
I principally rely upon that for my success; and my own
interest, having expended near 8000 l. to bring my
brewery to its present state, is the best security I can give
the publick to assure them of the best usage, without
which such an undertaking cannot be supported with
credit.</p>

<p>The casks to be paid for at the rate of 4s. for barrels,
5s. for those between 40 and 50 gallons, and a penny the
gallon for all above 50 gallons; but if they are returned in
good order, and sweet, by having been well scalded as
soon as emptied, the price of them shall be returned or
discounted.</p>

<p>Any person who sends bottles and corks may have them
carefully filled and corked with beer or porter at 6s. or
with ale at 4s. the dozen. I expect, in a little time, to
have constant supply of bottles and corks; and if I meet
the encouragement I hope for, propose setting up a
glasshouse for making bottles, and to provide proper
vessels to deliver to such customers as favour me with
their orders such liquors as they direct, at the several
landings they desire, being determined to give all the
satisfaction in the power of</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Their most humble servant,<br />
JOHN MERCER</p></blockquote>

<p>Foolhardy though the brewery was, a glass factory
would have been the pinnacle of folly. Yet it was
seriously on Mercer&#8217;s mind. In his letter to George
he wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Glass house to be built here must I am satisfied turn
to great profit, they have some in New England &amp; New
York or the Jerseys &amp; find by some resolves the New
England men are determined to increase their number.</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite his manifest failure, Mercer confidently
attempted to persuade George of the possibilities of
the brewery and even the glasshouse. Shifting from
one proposal to another, he suggested that he could
&#8220;rent out all my houses and conveniences at a reasonable
rate,&#8221; or take in a partner, although &#8220;I have so
great a dislike for all partnerships, nothing but my
inability to carry it on my self could induce me to
enter into one.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of these desperate thrashings about in a
struggle to survive, Mercer&#8217;s empire was collapsing.
When Monroe arrived as overseer, he</p>

<blockquote><p>found [according to Mercer] but 8 barrels of corn upon
my plantation, not enough at any of my quarters to
maintain my people, a great part of my Stock dead
(among them some of my English colts &amp; horses in the
2 last years to the am<sup>t</sup> of £ 375. 10. &mdash;) &amp; the rest of
them dying, which would have infallibly have been their
fate if it had not been for the straw of 1000 bushels of
barley &amp; the grains from the brewhouse.... Convinced
of his [Monroe&#8217;s] integrity, I have been forced
to submit the entire management of all the plantation
to him.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following passage from the letter summarizes
Mercer&#8217;s financial predicament:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I reced in 1764 £1548 ... 4 ... 3&frac12; &amp; in 1765
£961 ... 5 ... 4&frac12; but since I quitted my practice I
reced in 1766 no more than £108 ... 16 ... 1 of which
I borrowed £24.10.&mdash;&amp; 7 ... 1 ... 6 was re&#8217;ced for the
Governor&#8217;s fees. £20 ... 8 ... 4 I got for Opinions &amp;c
and from the brewery £28 ... 3 ... the remaining
£28 ... 16 is all I received out of several thousands
due for all my old &amp; new debts. In 1767 I reced
£159 ... 9 ... 3 of which borrowed £5 ... 15 ...&mdash;the
governor&#8217;s fees £10 ... 7 ... 6 reced for opinions
&amp;c. £49 ... 6 ...&mdash;from the brewhouse £66 ... 14 ...
of which £94 ... 14 ... 3 was from the brewery &amp; 9 in
1766 I gave a collector £20 besides his board ferrage &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
expences &amp; finding him horses &amp; his whole collection
during the year turned out to be £27 ... 2 ... 10. In
the two years my taxes levied and quitrents amounted
to £199 ... 8 ... 1 which would have left a ballance
of £1 . 13 . 3 in my favour in that time from the
brewery &amp; my practice (if it could be so called) &amp; all
my debts, in great part of which you and your brother
are jointly &amp; equally interested. What then remained
to support me &amp; a family consisting of about 26 white
people &amp; 122 negroes? Nothing but my crops, after
that I had expended above £100, for corn only to support
them, besides rice &amp; pork to near that value &amp;
the impending charge of £125 for rent, of £140 to
overseers yearly, remained, &amp; £94 ... 14 ... 3 out of
those crops, as I have already mentioned, proceeding
from the brewery, was swallowed up in taxes (tho the
people in England say we pay none, but I can fatally
prove that my estate from which I did not receive sixpence
has, since the commencement of the war, paid
near a thousand pounds in taxes only).&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On December 25, 1766, Mercer made public his
situation in Rind&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The great Number of Debts due to me for the last
seven Years of my Practice, and the Backwardness of
my Clients (in attending whose Business, I unhappily
neglected my own) to make me Satisfaction, would of
itself, if I had had no other Reason, have obliged me to
quit my Practice. And when I found that by such
partial Payments as I chanced to receive I was able
to keep up my Credit, I can appeal to the Public, whether
any Person, who had so many outstanding Debts, was
less importunate, or troublesome, to his Debtors, But
when I found, upon my quitting the Bar, all Payments
cease, and that I would not personally wait upon my
Clients, I could not approve of the Method of Demand,
by the Sheriff, too commonly in Practice, without
Necessity. I therefore employed a Receiver, who, ever
since the first day of <i>January</i> last, has been riding through
the <i>Northern Neck</i>, and even as far as <i>Williamsburg</i>, and
who to this Time has not been able, out of near ten
thousand Pounds, to collect as much as will pay his own
Wages, and discharge my public taxes (for Proof of
which I will produce my Books to any Gentleman concerned
or desirous to see them). This too, at a Time
when my own Debts contracted by the large Expences
I have been at for some Years past for establishing a
Brewery, has disabled me by any other Means from
discharging them, (except when they would take lands,
Assignments of Debts, or any thing I can spare, without
Detriment to my Plantations or Brewery). Selling
Lands avail nothing, I have bonds for some sold four
or five Years ago but I can&#8217;t get the Money for them.
I therefore cannot be thought too unreasonable to give
this public Notice (which the Circumstances of the
Country make most disagreeable to me) that I shall be
against my inclination obliged to bring Suits, immediately
after next <i>April</i> General Court, against all persons
indebted to me who do not before that Time, discharge
their Debts to me or my Son <i>James Mercer</i>, who will
have my Books during the said Court to settle with
every Person applying to him. And as some Persons
have since my quitting the Practice, sent to me for
Opinions and to settle Accounts without sending my
Fees, to prevent any more Applications of that Sort,
I give this Public Notice, that tho&#8217; I shall always be
ready to do any Thing of that Kind (which can be
done at my own House) upon receiving an adequate
Satisfaction for it, it will be in vain to expect it be any
Messenger they may send without they send the Money.
There are some Gentlemen who must know that nothing
in this Advertisement can relate to them but that any
of their Commands will at any Time, be readily complied
with by their</p>

<p>Andrew Monroe, as manager of the plantation,
advertised over his own name in Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s
<i>Virginia Gazette</i>, of April 18, 1766, the services of &#8220;The
well known Horse RANTER,&#8221; an English stallion
imported by Mercer in 1762 (<a href="#Fig_16">fig. 16</a>). One senses
that without Monroe, Marlborough would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
collapsed completely. In spite of his ministrations,
however, there were difficulties with the staff. Purdie
&amp; Dixon&#8217;s <i>Gazette</i> carried the following on June 6,
1766:</p>

<blockquote><p>MARLBOROUGH, STAFFORD county, May 26,
1766.</p>

<p>Run away from the subscriber, some time last <i>February</i>,
a Negro man named TEMPLE, about 35 years old, well
set, about 5 feet 6 inches high, has a high forehead, and
thick bush beard; he took a gun with him, and wore a
blue double breasted jacket with horn buttons. I
suspect he is harboured about <i>Bull Run</i>, in <i>Fauquier</i>
county, where he formerly lived. I bought him, with
his mother and sister, from Mr. <i>Barradall&#8217;s</i> executors in
<i>Williamsburg</i> above 20 years ago, and expected he would
have returned home; but as he has been so long gone, I
am doubtful he may endeavour to get out of the country
by water, of which he may understand something, as he
was two years on board the <i>Wolf</i> sloop of war in the
<i>West Indies</i>, and carries the marks of the discipline he
underwent on board.</p>

<p>Likewise run away last Whitsun holydays two indented
servants, imported from LONDON last September, viz.
JOSEPH WAIN of Bucknell, in the county of Oxford,
aged 22 years, about 5 feet 4 inches high, round shouldered,
stoops pretty much in his walk, has a down look,
and understands ploughing. WILLIAM CANTRELL
of Warwickshire, aged 19, about the same height, and
stoops a little, but not so much as WAIN, has a scar
under one of his eyes, but which is uncertain, has some
marks of the smallpox, his hair is of a dark brown and
short, but Wain&#8217;s is cut off, he pretends to understand
ploughing and country business, and has drove a waggon
since he has been in my service; they both have fresh
look. The clothes they left home in were jackets of red
plaids, brown linen shirts, <i>Russia</i> drill breeches with
white metal buttons, and thread stockings; <i>Cantrell</i> with
an old hat and new shoes, and <i>Wain</i> with a new
hat and old shoes; But as it is supposed that they were
persuaded to elope with four <i>Scotch</i> servants belonging
to the widow <i>Strother</i>, on <i>Potowmack</i> run in this county,
whom they went to see, and who went off at the same
time, it is probable that they may exchange their clothes,
or have provided some other. It is supposed that they
will make for <i>Carolina</i>, where it is said an uncle of one
of Mr. <i>Strother&#8217;s</i> servants lives; and as several horses are
missing about the same time in these parts, it is very
probable they did not choose to make such a journey
on foot. Whoever secures my servants and Negro, or
any of them shall, besides the reward allowed by law,
be paid any reasonable satisfaction, in proportion to
the distance and extraordinary trouble they may be
put to.</p>

JOHN MERCER</p></blockquote>

<p>Mercer seems to have been concerned principally
with his brewers and with the wasteful scheme they
furthered with their incompetencies. Even they
seem to have been beyond his strength, for he became
ill in January 1766, and suffered recurrently the
rest of the year. From his journal we can detect
a once-strong man&#8217;s struggle against the first warnings
of approaching death:</p>

<p>He informed George that after his return from Mr.
Selden&#8217;s on September 23 he was for &#8220;several days
under strong delerium and had the rattles.&#8221; By the
beginning of 1768, however, he was able to boast
that &#8220;I think I may safely aver that I have not been

<p>On April 22, 1766, he noted in the journal that the
&#8220;Kitchen roof catched fire&#8221; and on May 15 that he
&#8220;Took Possion [sic] of my summer house.&#8221; The
latter was probably located in the garden, where,
during his convalescence in the spring, he was able to
make a meticulous record of the blooming of each
plant, flower, tree, and shrub, constituting a most
interesting catalog of the wild and cultivated flora of
18th-century Marlborough. The catalog is indicative
of Mercer&#8217;s ranging interests and his knowledge of
botanical terms (see <a href="#Page_209">Appendix L</a>). That the garden
was perhaps as interesting as the house is borne out
by the fact that in 1750, as the house was reaching
completion, Mercer had brought from England a
gardener named William Blacke, paying Captain
Timothy Nicholson for his passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Mercer&#8217;s close attention to the natural phenomena
around him began with his illness in 1766. On
January 4, only a few days after he had become ill,
he installed a thermometer in his room, and eight
days later moved it to his office. Regularly,
from then until the close of his journal, except when
he was absent from Marlborough, he recorded the
minimum and maximum readings. One has only to
look at the figures for the winter months to realize
that &#8220;heated&#8221; rooms, as we understand them, were
little known in the 18th century. Only on Christmas
Eve in 1767 did the temperature range from a low
of 41&#176; to as high as 63&#176;, because, as Mercer noted,
&#8220;A good fire raised the Thermometer so high.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Mercer apparently found surcease from
his cares in the peaceful surroundings at Marlborough,
his responsibilities went on nevertheless. The cost of
keeping slaves remained an enormous and wasteful
one: &#8220;Every negroes cloaths, bedding, corn, tools,
levies &amp; taxes will stand yearly at least in £5,&#8221; he
wrote to George. In his letter he placed an order
through George for clothing, which included 25
welted jackets &#8220;for my tradesmen &amp; white servants,&#8221;
indicating the large number of white workmen on his
staff. It also included 20 common jackets, 45 pair of
woolen breeches, 1 dozen greatcoats, 5 dozen stockings,
1&frac12; dozen for boys and girls, 4 dozen &#8220;strong felt
hats &amp; 600 Ells of ozenbrigs. We shall make Virg<sup>a</sup>
cloth enough to cloath the women and children, but
shall want 50 warm blankets &amp; 2 doz of the Russia
drab breeches.&#8221; Against the advice of his merchant
friend Jordan, he declined to order a superior grade
of jacket for his Negroes that would last two years,
since &#8220;most negroes are so careless of their cloathes
&amp; rely so much on a yearly support that I think such
jackets as I had are cheapest &amp; last the year very
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ordered George to buy new sheeting for family
use, including &#8220;84 yds of such as is fit for comp<sup>a</sup>,&#8221;
inasmuch as &#8220;my wife is ashamed of her old sheets
when any strangers come to the house.&#8221; He also
placed an order for windmill sails, which, he observed,
were costly in the colony, and could be made only at
Norfolk.</p>

<blockquote><p>A Suit I had made at Norfolk by those dimensions
proved too long, something, they should be of Duck N<sup>o</sup>. 2.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition, he ordered nails, 50 yards of haircloth,
a yard wide, for the malt kiln, a &#8220;drill plow with
brass seed boxes for wheat, turnips, lucarn pease
&amp;c.,&#8221; and a considerable number of books, particularly
for his children. &#8220;Bob. Newbery at the

furnish you at the cheapest rate with books best
adapted to the real instruction as well as amusement
of children from two to six feet high.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long letter was finally finished on January 28,
1768, its great length partly dictated by the fact
that the river had frozen, immobilizing the posts.
He noted in his journal that on February 16 he was
in Fredericksburg and &#8220;dined at my Sons being my
birthday and 63 y<sup>rs</sup> old.&#8221; On the 24th he attended
a meeting of the Ohio Company at Stafford courthouse
and on March 14 returned there for a court
session. The next day he went home to Marlborough,
perhaps never to leave again. The journal ended at
the close of the month. The next that we hear of
him appeared in Rind&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> on October 27:</p>

<blockquote><p>On Friday, the 14th instant, died at his house in
Stafford County, John Mercer, Esq., who had practiced
the law with great success in this colony upwards of
forty years. He was a Gentleman of great natural
abilities inspired by an extensive knowledge, not only
in his profession, but in several other branches of polite
literature. He was of a humane, generous and chearful
disposition, a facetious companion, a warm friend, an
affectionate husband, a tender parent, and an indulgent
master.</p></blockquote>

<i>Dissolution of Marlborough</i></h3>


<p class="title">JAMES MERCER&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION
OF THE ESTATE</p>

<p>James Mercer was now &#8220;manager&#8221; of John Mercer&#8217;s
estate. George, heavily in debt, remained in England
never returning to Virginia. The staggering task of
rescuing the estate from bankruptcy was left to James.
The immediate necessity was to reduce wasteful
overhead at Marlborough and to liquidate non-essential
capital investment. On December 15, 1768,
James advertised in Rind&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A large and well chosen collection of BOOKS, being
all the library of the late <i>John Mercer</i>, Esq., deceased,
except such as are reserved for the use of his children.
Those to be sold consist of more than 1200 volumes
now at home, with which it is hoped may be reckoned
upwards of 400 volumes which appear to be missing by
the said <i>Mercer&#8217;s</i> catalogue.... The borrowers are
hereby requested to return them before the 19th of
<i>December</i> next, the day appointed for the appraising of
the estate....</p>

<p>Also to be sold, about 20 mares and colts, and 40 pair
of cows and calves. The colts are the breed of the
beautiful <i>horse Ranter</i>, who is for sale; his pedigree has
been formerly published in this Gazette, by which it will
appear he is as well related as any horse on the continent.
He cost 330 l. currency at his last sale, about 4 years
ago, and is nothing worse except in age, and that can be
but little in a horse kept for the sole use of covering....</p></blockquote>

<p>Except for attempting to dispose of the library and
the horses and livestock, no significant changes were
undertaken until after September 7, 1770, when John
Mercer&#8217;s widow, Ann Roy Mercer, died. Reduction
of the plantation to simpler terms then began in
earnest. Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> published
the following advertisement on October 25, 1770:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>To be</i> SOLD <i>on</i> Monday <i>the 19th of</i> November, <i>if fair</i>,
<i>otherwise next fair day</i>, at Marlborough, <i>the seat of the late</i>
John Mercer Esq: <i>deceased.</i></p>

<p>The greatest part of his personal estate (except slaves)
consisting of a variety of household furniture too tedious
to mention; a number of well chosen books, in good condition;
a very large and choice flock of horses, brood
mares, and colts, all blooded, and mostly from that very
beautiful and high bred horse <i>Ranter</i> a great number of
black cattle, esteemed the best in the colony, equal in
size to any beyond the Ridge, but superiour to them,
because they will thrive in shorter pastures; also 700
ounces of fashionable plate, and a genteel family coach,
not more than seven years old, seldom used, with harness
for six horses. Those articles were appraised, in December
1768, to 1738 l. The horses and black cattle are
since increased, and now are in very good order; so that
any person inclinable to purchase may depend on having
enough to choose out of.</p>

<p>Also will then be sold several articles belonging to a
BREWERY, <i>viz.</i> a copper that boils 500 gallons, several
iron bound buts that contain a whole brewing each,
coolers, &amp;c. &amp;c. and a quantity of new iron hoops and
rivets for casks of different forms, lately imported.</p>

<p>Purchasers above 6 l. will have credit until the <i>Fredericksburg
September</i> fair, on giving bond with security,
with interest from the day of sale; but if the money is
paid when due, the interest will be abated.</p>

<p>Proper vessels will attend at <i>Pasbytansy</i>, for the conveyance
of such as come from that side of <i>Potomack</i> Creek.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>It is clear that Ranter and his colts, as well as the
cattle, had not been disposed of at the former sale.
Further, it is obvious that there was an end to brewing
at Marlborough, a result which James must have
been all too glad to bring about.</p>

<p>This sale, however, was also unsuccessful. In the
May 9, 1771, issue of Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s <i>Virginia
Gazette</i> we learn that &#8220;The wet Weather last <i>November</i>
having stopped the Sale of the personal Estate of the
late <i>John Merser</i>, Esquire, the Remainder ... will
be sold at <i>Marlborough</i>, on Monday, the 27th of this
Month, if fair....&#8221; We learn that the family
beds, apparently alone of the furniture, had been
sold, and that the chariot had been added to the sales
list. Apparently the library still remained largely
intact, as &#8220;a great Collection of well chosen Books&#8221;
was included. Ranter was still for sale, now at a
five percent discount &#8220;allowed for ready money.&#8221;</p>

<p>But again&mdash;so an advertisement of June 13 reads in
the same paper&mdash;the sale was &#8220;prevented by bad
Weather.&#8221; June 20 was appointed the day for the
postponed sale. This time an additional item consisted
of 200 copies of Mercer&#8217;s &#8220;old Abridgment&#8221;
(doubtless the 1737 edition), to be sold at five shillings
each.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, James had employed one
Thomas Oliver, apparently of King George County,
as overseer for the four plantations which were in his
custody&mdash;Aquia, Accokeek, Belvedere, and Marlborough.
On May 31, 1771, Oliver made a detailed
report to Mercer on &#8220;the true state &amp; Condition of
the whole Estate and its Contents as they appear&#8217;d
when this return was fill&#8217;d up&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Included in it
was an inventory of every tool, outbuilding, vehicle,
and servant. The Marlborough portion of this is
given in <a href="#Page_211">Appendix M</a>. Oliver added an N.B. summarizing
the condition of the animals and the
physical properties. The following of his remarks are
applicable to Marlborough:</p>

<blockquote><p>... The work of the Mill going on as well as Can be
Expected till M<sup>r</sup>. Drains is better, the Schoo and Boat
unfit for any Sarvice whatsoever till repair&#8217;d. if Capable
of it. the foundation of the Malt house wants repairing.
the Manor house wants lead lights in some of the windows.
the East Green House wants repairing. the west
d<sup>o</sup> wants buttments as a security to the wall on the
south side. The barn, tobacco houses at Marlbrough &amp;
Acquia must be repaired as soon as possible.... five
stables at Marlbrough plantation must be repair&#8217;d
before winter. we have sustai&#8217;d no damage from Tempest
or Floods. it will Expedient to hyer a Carpinder for the
woork wanted can not be accomplish&#8217;d in time, seeing
the Carpenders must be taken of for harvest which is
Like to be heavy. I will advertise the sale at Stafford
Court and the two parish Churches to begin on the
20th of June 1771.... P.S. The Syder presses at
Each plantation &amp; Syder Mill at Marlborough totally
expended.... Negro Sampson Marlbro Company
Sick of the Gravel.... Negro Jas Pemberton at
Marlb<sup>h</sup> Sick Worme Fever.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sale as advertised and, presumably, as posted
by Oliver was again a failure. Apparently no one
attended. The situation must have been regarded
then as desperate, for James advertised on August 29,
1771, in Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> substantially
the same material as before. This time, however,
it was &#8220;To be SOLD, at the Townhouse in
<i>Fredericksburg</i>, on the 24th day of <i>September</i> next (being
the second Day of the Fair).&#8221; Added to the former
list were &#8220;About two Hundred Weight of HOPS of last
Crop,&#8221; &#8220;About four hundred Weight of extraordinary
good WOOL with a variety of Woollen and Linen
Wheels, Reels, &amp;c.,&#8221; as well as &#8220;A Number of
GARDEN FLOWER POTS of different forms.
Some ORANGE, LEMON and other EVERGREENS,
in Boxes and Pots.&#8221; The valuable but
unwanted Ranter was again put up.</p>

<p>But once more bad luck and an apathetic (and
probably impecunious) populace brought failure to
the sale. On October 24, 1771, Purdie &amp; Dixon&#8217;s
<i>Virginia Gazette</i> printed the following advertisement
and James Mercer&#8217;s final public effort to convert some
of his father&#8217;s estate into cash:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>To be</i> SOLD <i>to the highest Bidders</i>, <i>some Time Next Week</i>,
<i>before the</i> Raleigh <i>Tavern in Williamsburg,</i></p>

<p>The beautiful Horse RANTER, a genteel FAMILY
COACH, with Harness for six Horses, also several
Pieces of FASHIONABLE PLATE, yet remaining of
the Estate of the late John Mercer, Esquire, deceased.
Credit will be allowed until the 25th of April next, the
Purchasers giving Bond and Security, with Interest from
the Sale; but if the Money is paid when due, the Interest
will be abated.</p>

<p>Any Person inclinable to purchase RUSHWORTH&#8217;S
COLLECTION may see them at the Printing Office,
and know the Terms. At the same Place are lodged
several Copies of the old Abridgment of the VIRGINIA<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
LAWS, containing so many Precedents for Magistrates
that they are esteemed well worth five Shillings, the
Price asked for them.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
JAMES MERCER<br /></p>

<p><i>Williamsburg, October 24.</i></p>

<p>N.B. The Plate is lodged with Mr. Craig, and may be
seen by any inclinable to purchase.</p></blockquote>

<p>James did not attempt to sell the plantation itself
or the slaves, but evidently sought to reestablish
Marlborough on an efficient and profitable basis.
That he failed to do so is brought out in a letter that
George Mason wrote to George Washington on
December 21, 1773. In it is expressed the whole
tragic sequence of debt compounding debt in the
plantation economy and the insurmountable burden
of inherited obligations:</p>

<blockquote><p>The embarrass&#8217;d Situation of my Friend Mr. Jas. Mercer&#8217;s
Affairs gives Me much more Concern than Surprize. I
always feared that his Aversion to selling the Lands &amp;
Slaves, in Expectation of paying the Debts with the
Crops &amp; Profits of the Estate, whilst a heavy Interest
was still accumulating, wou&#8217;d be attended with bad
Consequences, independent of his Brother&#8217;s Difficulties
in England; having never, in a single Instance, seen
these sort of Delays answer the Hopes of the Debtor.
When Colo. [George] Mercer was first married, &amp;
thought in affluent circumstances by his Friends here,
considerable purchases of Slaves were made for Him, at
high prices (&amp; I believe mostly upon Credit) which
must now be sold at much less than the cost: He was
originally burthened with a proportionable part of his
Father&#8217;s Debts: most of which, as well as the old Gentleman&#8217;s
other Debts, are not only still unpaid, but must
be greatly increased by Interest; so that even if Colo.
Mercer had not incurr&#8217;d a large Debt in England, He
wou&#8217;d have found his Affairs here in a disagreeable

<p class="title">MARLBOROUGH DURING
AND AFTER THE REVOLUTION</p>

<p>Despite the seeming unwisdom of doing so, James
Mercer held on to Marlborough until his death.
He was an active patriot in the Revolution, serving
as a member of the Virginia Committee of Safety.
Marlborough, too, seems to have been a participant
in the war, when Lord Dunmore, on a last desperate
foray, sailed his ships up the Potomac and attacked
several plantations. That Marlborough was a target
we learn from the widow of Major George Thornton
of the Virginia militia, who &#8220;was at the bombardment
of Marlborough, the seat of Judge Mercer, on the
Potomac....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> In Purdie&#8217;s <i>Virginia Gazette</i> of
August 2, 1776, we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>Lord Dunmore, with his motley band of pirates and
renegradoes, have burnt the elegant brick house of
William Brent, esq., at the mouth of Acquia Creek, in
Stafford county, as also two other houses lower down
the Potowmack River, both the property of widow ladies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marlborough was no longer the property of a &#8220;widow
lady,&#8221; but accurate reporting even today is not
universal, and Marlborough may have been meant.
In any case, the mansion was not destroyed, although
we do not know whether any other buildings at
Marlborough were damaged or not.</p>

<p>John Francis Mercer, James&#8217; half brother, appears
to have lived at Marlborough after his return from
the Revolution. He served with distinction, becoming
aide-de-camp to the eccentric and difficult General
Charles Lee in 1778. When Lee was court-martialed
after the Battle of Monmouth, John Francis resigned,
but reentered the war in 1780.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> He apparently
settled at Marlborough after the surrender at Yorktown,
at which he was present. In 1782 he was
elected to both the Virginia House of Delegates and
the Continental Congress. General Lee died the
same year, stipulating in his will:</p>

<blockquote><p>To my friend John [Francis] Mercer, Esq., of Marlborough,
in Virginia, I give and bequeath the choice of
two brood mares, of all my swords and pistols and ten
guineas to buy a ring. I would give him more, but, as
he has a good estate and a better genius, he has sufficient,
if he knows how to make good use of them.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not probable that John Francis&#8217; &#8220;genius&#8221;
was sufficient to make profitable use of Marlborough.
He moved to Maryland in 1785, and later became its
Governor.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>James Mercer died on May 23, 1791. In 1799 the
Potomac Neck properties were advertised for sale or
rent by John Francis Mercer in <i>The Examiner</i> for
September 6. We learn from it that there were
overseer&#8217;s houses, Negro quarters and cornhouses,
and that &#8220;the fertility of the soil is equal to any in the
United States, besides which the fields all lay convenient
to banks (apparently inexhaustible) of the
richest marle, which by repeated experiments made
there, is found to be superiour to any other manure
whatever.&#8221; &#8220;30 or 40 Virginia born slaves, in
families, who are resident on the lands&#8221; were made
&#8220;available.&#8221;</p>


<p class="title">THE COOKE PERIOD:
MARLBOROUGH&#8217;S FINAL DECADES</p>

<p>The plantation was bought by John Cooke of
Stafford County. Cooke took out an insurance
policy on the mansion house on June 9, 1806, with
the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> From
this important document (<a href="#Fig_43">fig. 43</a>) we learn that the
house had a replacement value of $9000, and, after
deducting $3000, was &#8220;actually worth six thousand
Dollars in ready money.&#8221; The policy shows a plan
with a description: &#8220;Brick Dwelling House one Story
high covered with wood, 108 feet 8 Inches long by
28&frac12; feet wide, a Cellar under about half the House.&#8221;
Running the length of the house was a &#8220;Portico 108
feet 8 Inches by 8 feet 4 Inches.&#8221; A &#8220;Porch 10 by 5
f.&#8221; stood in front of the &#8220;portico,&#8221; and another was
located at the northeast corner of the building, &#8220;8 by
6 feet.&#8221; The policy informs us that the house was
occupied not by Cooke, but by John W. Bronaugh, a
tenant or overseer.</p>

<p>The records do not reveal how long the mansion
survived. That by the beginning of the century it had
already lost the dignity with which Mercer had
endowed it and was heading toward decay is quite
evident. After John Cooke&#8217;s death Marlborough was
again put up for sale in 1819, but this time nothing
was said of any buildings, only that the land was
adapted to the growth of red clover, that the winter
and spring fisheries produced $2500 per annum, and
that &#8220;Wild Fowl is in abundance.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly as the buildings disintegrated, their
sites were leveled. There remained only level acres
of grass, clover, and grain where once a poor village
had been erected and where John Mercer&#8217;s splendid
estate had risen with its Palladian mansion, its
gardens, warehouses, and tobacco fields. Even in the
early 19th century the tobacco plantation, especially
in northern Virginia, had become largely a thing of
the past. Within the memory of men still alive, the
one structure still standing from Mercer&#8217;s time was
the windmill. Except for the present-day fringe of
modern houses, Marlborough must look today much
as it did after its abandonment and disintegration.</p>

<i>The Site, its Problem,
and Preliminary Tests</i></h3>

<p>The preceding chapters have presented written
evidence of Marlborough&#8217;s history and of the human
elements that gave it life and motivation. Assembled
mostly during the years following the excavations,
this information was not, for the most part, available
in 1956 to guide the archeological survey recounted
here. Neither was there immediate evidence on the
surface of the planted fields to indicate the importance
and splendor of Marlborough as it existed in the 18th
century.</p>

<p>In 1954, when Dr. Darter proposed that the Smithsonian
Institution participate in making excavations,
he presented a general picture of colonial events at
Marlborough. He also provided photostats of the
two colonial survey plats so frequently mentioned in
Part I (<a href="#Fig_2">fig. 2</a>). From information inscribed on the
1691 plat, it was clear that a town had been laid out
in that year, that it had consisted of 52 acres divided
into half-acre lots, and that two undesignated acres
had been set aside for a courthouse near its western
boundary. It was known also that John Mercer had
occupied the town in the 18th century, that he had
built a mansion there, that a circular ruin of dressed
lime-sandstone was the base of his windmill, and that
erosion along the Potomac River bank had radically
changed the shoreline since the town&#8217;s founding 263
years earlier. But nobody in 1954 could point out
with any certainty the foundation of Mercer&#8217;s
mansion, nor was anyone aware of the brick and the
stone wall system, the two-room kitchen foundation,
or the trash pits and other structures that lay beneath
the surface, along with many 18th-century household
artifacts. It remained for the archeologist to recover
such nonperishable data from the ground.</p>

<p>In August 1954 Messrs. Setzler, Darter, and Watkins
spent three days at Marlborough examining the site,
making tests, and, in general, determining whether
there was sufficient evidence to justify extended
excavations. The site is located in the southeastern
portion of what was known in the 17th century as
Potowmack Neck (now Marlborough Point), with the
Potomac River on the east and Potomac Creek on the
south (map, front endpaper). It is approached from
the northeast on Highway 621, which branches from
Highway 608 about 2&frac12; miles from the site. Highway
608 runs from Aquia Creek westward to the village of
Brooke, situated on the Richmond, Fredericksburg,
and Potomac Railroad about four miles east of the
present Stafford courthouse on U.S. Route 1. Highway
621 takes a hilly, winding course through the
woods until it debouches onto the flat, open peninsula
of the point. The river is visible to the east, as the
road travels slightly east of due south, passing an
intersecting secondary road that runs west and south
and then west again. The latter road ends at the
southwestern extremity of the Neck, where Accokeek
Creek, which meanders along the western edge of
the Neck, feeds into Potomac Creek. At the point
near the Potomac Creek shore where this road takes
its second westerly course lies the site of the Indian
village of Patawomecke, excavated between 1938
and 1940 by T. D. Stewart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">Figure 19.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Highway 621</span>, looking north from the curve in the road, with
site of Structure B at right.</span>
</div>

<p>Beyond this secondary road, Highway 621 continues
southward to a small thicket and clump of trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
where it curves sharply to the east, its southerly course
stopped by fenced-in lots of generous size (with
modern houses built on them) that slope down to
Potomac Creek. After the highway makes its turn,
several driveways extend from it toward the creek.
One of these driveways, obviously more ancient
than the others, leaves the highway about 200 feet
east of the clump of trees, cutting deeply through
high sloping banks, where vestiges of a stone wall
crop out from its western boundary (<a href="#Fig_22">fig. 22</a>), and
ending abruptly at the water&#8217;s edge. Highway 621
continues to a dead end near the confluence of creek
and river.</p>

<p>Some 200 feet west of the turn in the highway
around the clump of trees, is a deep gully (or &#8220;gutt&#8221;
in 17th-century terminology) that extends northward
from Potomac Creek almost as far as the intersecting
road that passes the site of the Indian village. This
gully is overgrown with trees and brush, and it forms
a natural barrier that divides the lower portion of the
point into two parts. A few well-spaced modern
houses fringe the shores of the point, while the flat
land behind the houses is given over almost entirely
to cultivation.</p>

<p>Since the two colonial land surveys were not drawn
to scale, some confusion arose in 1954 as to their
orientation to the surviving topographic features.
However, the perimeter measurements given on the
1691 plat make it clear that the town was laid out in
the southeastern section of the point, and that the
&#8220;gutt&#8221; so indicated on the plat is the tree-lined
gully west of the turn in the highway.</p>

<p>Bordering the clump of trees at this turn could
be seen in 1954 a short outcropping of brick masonry.
A few yards to the north, on the opposite side of the
road, crumbled bits of sandstone, both red and gray,
were concentrated in the ditch cut by a highway
grader. In the fields at either side of the highway,
plow furrows disclosed a considerable quantity of
brick chips, 18th-century ceramics, and glass sherds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>In the field east of the clump of trees and north of
the highway, opposite the steep-banked side road
leading down to Potomac Creek, could be seen in a
row the tops of two or three large pieces of gray stone.
These stones were of the characteristic lime-sandstone
once obtained from the Aquia quarries some four
miles north, as well as from a long-abandoned quarry
above the head of Potomac Creek. It was decided
to start work at this point by investigating these
stones, in preference to exploring the more obvious
evidence of a house foundation at the clump of trees.
This was done in the hope of finding clues to lot
boundaries and the possible orientation of the survey
plats. Excavation around these vertically placed
stones disclosed that they rested on a foundation
layer of thick slabs laid horizontally at the undisturbed
soil level. Enough of this wall remained <i>in situ</i> to
permit sighting along it toward Potomac Creek.
The sight line, jumping the highway, picked up the
partly overgrown stone wall that extends along the
western edge of the old roadway to the creek, indicating
that a continuous wall had existed prior to
the present layout of the fields and before the construction
of the modern highway.</p>

<p>The excavation along the stone wall was extended
northward. At a distance of 18.5 feet from the highway
the stone wall ended at a junction of two brick
wall foundations, one running north in line with the
stone wall and the other west at a 90&#176; angle. These
walls, each a brick and a half thick, were bonded in
oystershell lime mortar. Test trenches were dug to the
north and west to determine whether they were
enclosure walls or house foundations. Since it was
soon evident that they were the former, the next
question was whether they were lot boundaries
matching those on the plat. If so, it was reasoned,
then a street must have run along the east side of the
north-south coursing wall. Accordingly, tests were
made, but no supporting evidence for this inference
was found.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the indications of an elaborate wall
system, a probable house foundation, and a wealth of
artifacts in the soil were enough to support a full-scale
archeological project, the results of which would have
considerable historical and architectural significance.
Determining the meaning of the walls and whether
they were related to the town layout or to Mercer&#8217;s
plantation, learning the relationship of the plantation
to the town, discovering the sites of the 1691 courthouse
and Mercer&#8217;s mansion, and finding other house
foundations and significant artifacts&mdash;all these were
to be the objectives of the project. The problem,
broadly considered, was to investigate in depth a
specific locality where a 17th-century town and an
18th-century plantation had successively risen and
fallen and to evaluate the evidence in the light of
colonial Virginia&#8217;s evolving culture and economy.
Accordingly, plans were made, a grant was obtained
from the American Philosophical Society, as recounted
in the introduction, and intensive work on the site
was begun in 1956.</p>

<i>Archeological Techniques</i></h3>

<p>The archeologist must adopt and, if necessary,
invent the method of excavation best calculated to
produce the results he desires, given the conditions of
a particular site. The Marlborough site required
other techniques than those conventionally employed,
for instance, in excavating prehistoric American
Indian sites. Moreover, because the Marlborough
excavations constituted a limited exploratory survey,
the grid system used customarily in colonial-site
archeology was not appropriate here, and a different
system had to be substituted. It was decided in 1956
to begin, as in 1954, at obvious points of visible
evidence and to follow to their limits the footings of
walls and buildings as they were encountered, rather
than to remove all of the disturbed soil within a
limited area. By itself this was a simple process, but
to record accurately what was found by this method
and relate the features to each other required the use
mainly of an alidade and a stadia rod. Only to a
limited extent were some exploratory trenches dug
and careful observations made of the color and
density of soil, so as to detect features such as wooden
house foundations, postholes, and trash pits. Once
located, such evidence had to be approached meticulously
with a shaving or slicing technique, again
taking careful note of soil changes in profile.</p>

<p>All this required the establishment of an accurate
baseline and a number of control points by means of
alidade and stadia-rod measurements. Then eight
points for triangulation purposes in the form of iron
pipes were established at intervals along the south
side of the highway, east of its turn at the clump of
trees, on the basis of which the accompanying maps
were plotted. The full extent of the excavations is
not shown in detail on these maps, particularly in
connection with the walls and structures. The walls,
for example, were exposed in trenches 5 feet wide.
Similar trenches were dug around the house foundations
as evidence of them was revealed.</p>

<br />
<i>Wall System</i></h3>


<p class="title">DESCRIPTIONS OF EXCAVATIONS</p>

<p>On April 2, 1956, the junction point of the three
walls found in the 1954 test was reexcavated. The
bottom layer of horizontally placed stones 1.8-1.9
feet wide was found <i>in situ</i>, while most of the vertical
stones from the second course had been broken or
knocked off by repeated plowing. Construction of
the highway had completely removed a section of
the wall. The corner of the two brick walls was
revealed to have been superimposed on the northernmost
foundation block of the stone wall, thus indicating
that the stone wall preceded the building
of the brick ones. The upper stone block that had
been removed to make room for this brick corner
still lay a few feet to the east where it had been cast
aside in the 18th century. This part of the stone wall,
together with its continuation beyond the highway to
the creek, was designated Wall A (<a href="#Fig_21">figs. 21</a> and <a href="#Fig_24">24</a>).</p>

<p>Exposure of the brick wall running westward from
Wall A (designated Wall A-I) disclosed broken gaps
in the brickwork, the gaps ranging from 1.8 to 3 feet
in length, and the intervening stretches of intact
wall, from 7.33 to 8 feet. Eight-foot spacings are
normal for the settings of modern wooden fence
posts, as such a fence south of the highway illustrated.
It is assumed, therefore, that, following the destruction
of the exposed part of the brick wall, a wooden
fence was built along the same line, requiring the
removal of bricks to permit the setting of fence posts
(<a href="#Fig_26">fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p>Wall A-I intersected the modern highway at an
acute angle, disappeared thereunder and reappeared
beyond. South of the clump of trees it abutted
another wall of different construction which ran
continuously in the same direction for 28 feet. Because
of their manner of construction, the two walls
at their point of juncture were not integrated and,
hence, probably were constructed at different times.
The 28-foot section later proved to be the south wall
of the mansion, designated as B. (This wall will be
considered when that structure is described, as will
another section that continued for less than 4 feet to
the point where a 12-foot modern driveway crossed
over it.)</p>

<p>To the west of the driveway another wall (B-I),
still in line with Wall A-I, extended toward the
&#8220;gutt.&#8221; Of this only one brick course remained, a
brick and a half thick. About midway in its length
were slight indications that the wall footings had been
expanded for a short distance, as though for a gate;
however, the crumbled condition of the brick and
mortar fragments made this inference uncertain.</p>

<p>Near the edge of the &#8220;gutt,&#8221; 146 feet from the
southwest corner of the Structure B main foundation,
Wall B-I terminated in an oblique-angled corner,
the other side of which was designated Wall B-II.
This wall ran 384 feet in a southwesterly direction
under trees and beneath a boathouse along the
&#8220;gutt,&#8221; ending at the back of Potomac Creek. It
was constructed of rough blocks of the fossil-imbedded
marl that underlies Marlborough and crops out along
the Potomac shore. Walls A, A-I, B-I, and B-II,
together with the creek bank, form an enclosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
measuring a little over two acres.</p>

<p>Returning to the point of beginning excavation, the
brick wall which is extended north from stone wall A
(designated as Wall A-II) was followed for a distance
of 175 feet. Like Wall A-I, it was a brick and a
half thick (a row of headers lying beside a row of
stretchers), and was represented for a distance of 36
feet by two courses. Beyond this point for another
30 feet, a shift in the contour of the land, allowing
deeper plowing in relation to the original height of
the wall, had caused the second course of bricks to be
knocked off. From there on, only occasional clusters
of bricks remained, the evidence of the wall consisting
otherwise of a thin layer of mortar and brick.</p>

<p>Wall A-II terminated in a corner. The other side
of the corner was of the same construction and ran
westerly at right angles for a total distance of 264.5
feet, passing beneath the highway (north of the turn)
and stopping against the southeast corner of a structure
designated E. Extending south from Structure E
was an 84-foot wall (Wall E) a brick and a half
thick, laid this time in Flemish bond (header-stretcher-header)
in several courses.</p>

<p>Another east-west wall, of which only remnants
were found, joined Wall E and its southern terminus.
Six feet west of Wall E this fragmentary wall widened
from three to four bricks in thickness in what appeared
to be the foundation of a wide gate, with a heavy
iron hinge-pintle <i>in situ</i>; beyond this it disappeared
in a jumble of brickbats.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the wall excavations, a return
was made to Wall A, where a visible feature had
been observed, although not investigated. This
feature was a three-sided, westward projection from
Wall A, similarly built of Aquia-type stone, forming
with Wall A a long, narrow enclosure. The southern
east-west course of this structure meets Wall A
approximately 62 feet north of the creek-side terminus
of Wall A and extends 59 feet to the west. The
north-south course runs 100 feet to its junction with
the northern east-west segment. The latter segment
is only 55 feet long, so the enclosure is not quite
symmetrical. No excavations were made here.
However, in line with the north cross wall of the
enclosure, trenches were dug at four intervals in a
futile effort to locate evidence of a boundary wall in
the present orchard lying to the east of the road to
the creek.</p>

<p>In addition to the artifacts listed above numerous
others were excavated from the trenches, although
few of these have archeological value for purposes of
analyzing the structures. Only the finds accompanied
by depth and provenience data are significant in
evaluating these structures, and in the case of the
gateway few are helpful to any degree. The fragmentary
bottle seal found there matches exactly a
whole seal that occurs on a wine bottle described in
a subsequent section. That seal is dated 1737, and
thus this seal must have been similarly dated. Its
presence near the lowest level suggests that the wall
was in construction at the time the seal was deposited.
Bottles were used for a long time, however, so the
seal may have reached its final resting place years
later than 1737. The Indian celt no doubt fell from
the topsoil while the trench in which the wall was
built was being excavated. The swingletree gear
next to it probably was left there during the construction.
The colter, although it appears to be of early
18th-century origin, may have been in use late in
the 18th century after the wall had been removed.
Since the colter is badly bent, it may have struck the
top of the underground wall foundation, and, having
been torn off from the plow, perhaps was left on the
bricks where it fell.</p>

<p class="title">HISTORICAL DATA AND
INTERPRETATION OF WALL SYSTEM</p>

<p>John Mercer commented with exasperation in his
Land Book about the unresolved discrepancies between
the Buckner survey of 1691 and the missing
Gregg survey of 1707 (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>). There are as many
disparities between Buckner&#8217;s plat and the plat
resulting from the Savage survey of 1731. In the
latter a new row of lots is added along the western
boundary, pushing the Buckner lots eastward.
Where in the Buckner plat the lots and streets in
the lower part of the town west of George Andrews&#8217;
lots turn westerly 1&#176; from the indicated main axis
of the town, paralleling the 30-pole fourth course of
the town bounds which runs to the creek&#8217;s edge, the
Savage map shows no such change. Yet Savage, in
describing the courses of the survey in a written note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
on the plat, shows that he followed the original bounds.
He does note a 4&#176;, 10-pole error in the course along
Potomac Creek, &#8220;which difference gives several
Lots more than was in the old survey making one
Row of Lots more than was contained therein each
containing two thirds of an Acre.&#8221; This was doubtless
a contrivance designed to reconcile the Gregg
and Buckner surveys and also to benefit John Mercer.</p>

<p>In any case, it is clear that the plats themselves are
both unreliable and inaccurate. What was actual
was shown in the archeological survey of 1956 with
its record of boundary walls and at least one street.
An attempt has been made in <a href="#Fig_14">figure 14</a> to give scale
to the Buckner survey by superimposing the archeological
map over it. There, Wall B-II, if extended
north for 111 feet beyond its length of 384 feet to equal
the 30 poles (495 feet) of the fourth course, would
exactly touch the southwest corner of lot 21 where the
fourth course began. But, in spite of this congruence,
the other features of the plat are distorted and disagree
with the slightly northwest-southeast basic
orientation of the street and wall system. The
simplest explanation might be that the layout was
made on the basis of the 1707 Gregg survey. Since
it was following the second Act for Ports of 1705 that
the town achieved what little growth it made prior
to Mercer&#8217;s occupancy, it is probable that the town&#8217;s
orientation was made according to this survey.</p>

<p>Whether or not this is the case, the road to the creek
side was fundamental to the town, and probably was
built early in its history and maintained after the town
itself was abandoned. We know from archeological
evidence that Wall A antedates the brick walls that
were connected with it. Further evaluation of the
wall system in relation to the entire site will be made
later. It may be concluded for now that Wall A
and the road beside it represent the main axis of the
town as it was laid out before Mercer&#8217;s arrival, that
the stone walls were built before that event, that Wall
B-II follows the fourth course somewhat according to
Buckner&#8217;s plat, and that the brick walls may date as
late as 1750, as some of the associated artifacts suggest.</p>

(<i>Structure B</i>)</h3>


<p class="title">DESCRIPTION OF EXCAVATIONS</p>

<p>With the exception of Wall A, the protruding bit of
brickwork near the clump of trees (where Highway
621 makes its turn to the southeast) was the only
evidence remaining above ground in 1956 of Marlborough&#8217;s
past grandeur. Designated Structure B, it
was plainly the remains of a cellar foundation, which
the tangled thicket of vines and trees adjacent to it
tended to confirm. Since its location corresponded
with the initially estimated position of the courthouse,
it seemed possible that the foundation might have
survived from that structure.</p>

<p>Excavation of Structure B began accidentally when
the excavators began following the westward course
of Wall A-I, as described in the preceding section on
the &#8220;Wall System.&#8221; Wall A-I abutted, but did not
mesh with, the corner of two foundation walls, one of
which ran northward and the other continued on for
28 feet in the same direction as Wall A-I. The brickwork
in the 28-foot stretch of Wall A-I was laid in a
step-back, buttress-type construction. At the bottom
course the wall was 2.65 feet thick, diminishing
upward for five successive courses to a minimum of
1.5 feet. A wall running northward&mdash;the east foundation
wall&mdash;was exposed for 16 feet from the point of
its junction with Wall A-I until it disappeared under
the highway. It was found to have the same buttress-type
construction. There was no evidence of a cellar
within the area enclosed by the foundation walls south
of the highway.</p>

<p>Excavation of the east foundation wall was resumed
north of the highway, but here no buttressing was
found, with evidence of a cellar visible instead.
This evidence consisted of a curious complex of
features, comprising remnants of two parallel cross
walls only 4.5 feet apart with a brick pavement
between 4.8 feet below the surface. The east wall
and the cross walls had flush surfaces. The northerly
cross wall was tied into the brickwork of the east wall,
showing that it was built integrally with the foundation.
The northerly cross wall had been knocked
down, however, to within five courses on the floor
level. The pavement was fitted against it.</p>

<p>The southerly cross wall was not tied into the brickwork
of the east wall, and the pavement had been
torn up next to it. Thus it was evident that this wall
had been erected subsequent to the building of the
foundation, that it had shortened the cellar by 4.5
feet, and that the cellar extended southward to a
point beneath the highway where it was impossible
to excavate. Documentary evidence to confirm this
alteration will be shown below (<a href="#Page_91">p. 91</a>).</p>

<p>Extending 12.5 feet north of the original cross wall
was another cellarless section, with step-back buttressing
again featuring the foundation wall. Another
paved cellar was in evidence north of this, extending
for 26 feet, with a final 14.25-foot cellarless portion
as far as the north wall of the structure. The interior
of the cellar, to the extent that inviolate trees and
shrubs made it possible to determine, was filled with
brickbats and debris, large portions of which were
removed. Evidence, however, of construction of cross
walls and of floor treatment remained concealed.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 33.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Site of Structure</span> B before excavating, looking northeast.</span>
</div>

<p>The entire length of this extraordinary foundation
totaled 108 feet.</p>

<p>The northwest corner of Structure B was not excavated
because it was hidden beneath a group of
cedar trees which could not be disturbed. South of
the trees, however, the section of the west-wall
foundation was exposed to a length of 15.5 feet. This
section was situated partly in, and partly north of, the
north cellar area. The cross measurement, from
outer edge to outer edge, was 28 feet, the same as the
length of the south foundation wall. Another short
section of the west foundation wall also was exposed
from the southwest corner as far as a private driveway
which limited the excavation.</p>

<p>Abutting the exterior of the north wall of the foundation
a flagstone pavement was found, extending 8.45
feet northward and 16 feet westward from the northeast
corner. Against the foundation, within this
space, was a U-shaped brick wall, forming a hollow
rectangle 5 feet by 3.6 feet (inside). The space was
filled with ashes, loose bricks, and other refuse. This
brickwork was the foundation for a small porch, the
lime-sandstone slabs surrounding it having been an
apron or a small terrace.</p>

<p>Extending westward from the cedar trees, beyond
the projected 28-foot length of the north wall, was a
short section of brick wall foundation, the outer
surface of which was faced with slabs of red sandstone
and dressed on the top with a cyma-reversa molding.
The tops of the slabs were rough, but each had slots
and channels for receiving iron tie bars (<a href="#Dr_3">ill. 3</a>) that
were still in place. This wall was inset four inches
to the south of the alignment of the main north
foundation wall.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 34.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Southwest corner of Structure B.</span> Piazza foundation extends to left, with
red sandstone block at junction of piazza with main foundation. To the left of top of
sign, molded red-sandstone trim can be seen which apparently surrounded the piazza.
Bricks in front of trim appear to have been added later as step foundation. Brick buttressing
of main-foundation footing appears at right.</span>
</div>

<p>The northwest corner of this additional structure
was hidden under the highway. Even now, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the discerning eye can pick up the contour of a wall
running parallel with the west foundation wall under
the blacktop pavement. For a brief distance, between
the point where the road swings eastward from it and
the private driveway covers it again, excavation
exposed this wall. Designated Wall C, it was 22
inches thick, entirely of brick, with no evidence
remaining of red sandstone on the outside. The
exterior surface was 9.5 feet beyond the west foundation
wall.</p>

<p>At the southwest corner of the foundation, evidence
matching that at the northwest corner was found.
Here, again inset 4 inches from the line of the
main south foundation wall, were to be seen the tops
of red-sandstone slabs like those found at the north
end (<a href="#Fig_36">fig. 36</a>), in this case with one tie rod still in
place. The driveway obscured the point to which
the corner of this extending structure could presumably
be projected. Subsequent construction against
the sandstone slabs had covered their surfaces with
a rubble of brick and mortar that appeared to be the
foundation for masonry steps (<a href="#Fig_35">fig. 35</a>). Projecting
out from the southwest corner of the foundation was
a rectangular red-sandstone block which appeared
to be the corner of these superimposed steps. Although
situated under the driveway, it was apparent
by projection that Wall B-I joined the southwest
corner of Wall C. It will be demonstrated from
surviving records that Wall C, with its connecting
sections, was the foundation of a full-length veranda.</p>

<p>The belief which persisted for a time that Structure
B might have been the courthouse was dispelled by
documentary evidence showing that it was John
Mercer&#8217;s mansion.</p>

<p>In addition, there was the usual variety of 18th-century
delftware, Nottingham and white salt-glazed
stoneware, pieces of a Westerwald stoneware
chamber pot, and much miscellaneous iron, of which
only a hinge fragment and a supposed shutter
fastener probably were associated with the house.
None of this material has provenience data, nearly
all of it having turned up in the process of trenching.
Little of it, therefore, throws much light on the history
of the structure. The most important artifacts found
in and around Structure B are those of an architectural
nature, and these will be considered primarily in the
following section.</p>


<p class="title">ARCHITECTURAL DATA
AND ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURE B</p>

<p>That the &#8220;manor house,&#8221; as Thomas Oliver called
it in 1771, was an extraordinary building is both revealed
in the Structure B foundation and confirmed
by the insurance-policy sketch of 1806. Long, low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and narrow, fronted by a full-length veranda and
adorned with stone trim for which we can find no
exact parallel in 18th-century America, it was as individualistic
as John Mercer himself. Yet, far from
being a vernacular anachronism or a mere eccentricity,
it was apparently rich with the Georgian mannerisms
that made it very much an expression of its age.</p>

extends to bottom of picture at left. Molded-sandstone trim appears through
brick rubble that has been attached to it, evidently as base for steps.</span>
</div>

<p>The measurements made of the foundation when
excavated, as we have seen, show a length of 108 feet
and a width of 28 feet for the main structure, with an
overall width, including the projecting Wall C, of 37
feet 6 inches. The insurance policy states a length of
108 feet 8 inches and a width of 29 feet 6 inches for
the main foundation, plus a separate width for the
&#8220;portico&#8221; (as the structure above Wall C was called)
of 8 feet 4 inches. These small discrepancies probably
lie in the differences between measuring a standing
house and a foundation.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the foundation was far from
fully excavated because of the presence of trees and
highway, it is clear, nevertheless, that two cellars of
unequal size were situated within the main foundation,
separated by sections where there were no cellars.
These findings correspond with the notation on the
insurance-policy plan, &#8220;a Cellar under about half the
House.&#8221;</p>

at left and added cross wall at right. Mercer probably referred to the latter
in 1749 in his account with Thomas Barry: &#8220;Underpinning and altering
the cellar.&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>The partly destroyed cross wall extends about midway
across the foundation, acting as a retaining wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
As described above, this cross wall was found to be
tied into the brick pavement that abutted it on the
south side.</p>

<p>The bricks in the main foundation walls and in the
partly destroyed cross wall and pavement, on the basis
of sample measurements, show a usual dimension of
about 8&frac12; by 2&frac34; by 4 inches. An occasional 9-inch
brick occurs&mdash;about 10 percent of the sample.</p>

<p>In contrast, the bricks in the second cross wall are
all 9 inches long, except two that are 8&frac12; inches and
one that is 8&frac34; inches. Similar sizes prevail in the
bricks exposed in the &#8220;portico&#8221; foundation (Wall C)
at the south end. The significance of these brick
sizes will be discussed later.</p>

<p>It is clear that Wall C was the foundation of the
&#8220;portico,&#8221; and that by &#8220;portico&#8221; the writer of the
insurance policy meant veranda or loggia. The policy
also shows a &#8220;Porch 10 by 5 f.&#8221; extending from the
middle of the veranda. The highway now covers
this spot.</p>

<p>In the space between the two parallel cross walls
within the main foundation, the debris yielded a large
section of a heavy, red-sandstone arch, 14 inches wide,
9 inches thick, and 3 feet 2 inches long. This arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was roughhewn on the flat surfaces and on about half
of the outer curved surface, or extrados. The inner
surface, or intrados, and the remainder of the extrados
are smoothly dressed (<a href="#Fig_38">fig. 38</a>). At the south end of
the main foundation another curved red-sandstone
piece was recovered. This piece curves laterally and
has a helically sloped top surface. It is 25 inches long,
14&frac12; inches high at the highest point, and 9 inches
thick. Presumably, it was part of a flanker for a
formal outdoor stair or steps (<a href="#Fig_39">fig. 39</a>). Also at the
south end was found a cast-mortar block with grooves
on the back for metal or wooden fastenings (USNM
59.1823; <a href="#Fig_40">fig. 40</a>). This was perhaps part of a simulated
ashlar doorframe. A few gauged or &#8220;rubbed&#8221;
bricks occur that are slightly wedge shaped.</p>

<p>Turning to the documentary evidence, one may
recall that an item dated September 1747, &#8220;By
building part of my House,&#8221; appeared in David
Minitree&#8217;s account in Ledger G. Two years later,
in 1749, several items related to the house appeared
in the account of Thomas Barry, &#8220;By Building the
Addition to my House/ By 22 Arches/ By 900 Coins &amp;
Returns/ By a Frontispiece/ By Underpinning &amp;
altering the Cellar.&#8221; In 1749 and 1750 William
Copein was paid for mason&#8217;s work.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a clear sequence here. &#8220;Building part of
my house&#8221; referred to the basic brick structure built
in 1747 by Minitree on the main foundation. The
work of William Monday, the carpenter, followed in
1748. This doubtless included building the roof,
setting beams, laying floors, and building partitions.
Then in 1749 Barry built the &#8220;Addition to my
House&#8221;&mdash;almost certainly the veranda. The item
for 22 arches is difficult to understand unless one
relates it to the veranda and divides the figure in two.
The veranda was probably an arcade having 11 arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
openings, with arched facings of rubbed brick both
inside and outside the arcade. Thus, for the bricklayer,
each actual arch would have required two
arches of brick. The intrados, or undersurfaces, of
the arches were probably red sandstone, like the fragmentary
arch found in the site; the basic element of
the arch was then faced on each side with bricks also
arranged in an arch formation. The arcade at
Hanover courthouse seems to have been built in a
somewhat similar fashion, except that there the brick
facing appears on the exterior of the arch only. The
&#8220;900 Coins and Returns&#8221; probably are gauged bricks,
that is, bricks ground smooth on a grindstone to
provide a different texture and richer red color to
contrast with the ordinary wall brick. They were
widely used in Virginia mansions of the 18th century
for corner and arch decoration. At Marlborough over
600 rubbed bricks would have been required to trim
the piers of 11 arches, while the remainder may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
decorated the porch. The porch, we may be sure,
was the &#8220;Frontispiece.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 43.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Foundation of porch</span> at north end of Structure B, surrounded

</div>

<p>The item for &#8220;Underpinning &amp; altering the cellar&#8221;
probably refers to the knocked-out original cross wall
and the added parallel cross wall, although the reasons
for the change will always remain a mystery. As has
been noted, the average brick sizes in the main foundation,
on the one hand, and those of bricks in the new
cellar cross wall and in the veranda were mostly
different. Probably the distinctions represent the
differences between Minitree&#8217;s and Barry&#8217;s bricks.</p>

</div>

<p>The detailed sequence of joiners&#8217;, plasterers&#8217;, and
painters&#8217; work during the 1748-1750 period has
already been given attention in the historical section,
enough to indicate that the mansion was one of luxurious
appointments. The insurance policy describes
it as a &#8220;Brick Dwelling House one Story high covered
with wood.&#8221; In modern parlance this would be
called a story-and-a-half house with a wood-shingled
roof. The veranda, probably in the form of an
arcade, was trimmed with dressed red sandstone and
perhaps paved with the squares and oblongs of this
material found scattered around the site. The small
projecting porch mentioned in the insurance policy
provided a central pavilion. The appearance of the
house from here on must be left wholly to speculation
with only hints to guide us. We know, for instance,
that a considerable amount&mdash;three books&mdash;of gold leaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
was employed. Was there, perhaps, a small gilded
cupola to break the long expanse of roof line? Were
the 162 ballusters, purchased from George Elliott
towards the time of completion, made for staircases
indoors or for a balustrade along the roof? Or did
they border the roof of the veranda? To these questions
there can be no answer. Another question is
whether the house, described as one story high, was
built over a high basement or near ground level.
Here we have evidence pointing to the latter, since
the foundation had two separate cellars, equalling
&#8220;a Cellar under about half the House.&#8221; A high or
English basement, by contrast, would have been
continuous. Furthermore, the veranda was at, or
near, the ground level. The ground floor thus might
have been as much as 3 feet higher, reached by steps
from the veranda&mdash;but not a whole story higher.
The depth of the cellars, ranging from about 4
to 5 feet below ground level, implies that the first
floor was not more than 3 feet above ground level.</p>

<p>Suggestions as to details of trim and finish are
made here and there, again in fragmentary hints.
Several broken pieces of a dark-gray, fossil-embedded
marble survive from the &#8220;chimney-pieces&#8221; and
hearths of fireplaces (<a href="#Fig_42">fig. 42</a>). They may be the
&#8220;hewn stone from Mr. Nicholson&#8221; paid for in 1749.
A piece of plaster cyma-recta cornice molding shows
that some rooms, at least, had plaster rather than
wooden ceiling trim (USNM 59.1829, <a href="#Dr_4">ill. 4</a>).
Thomas Oliver&#8217;s statement that &#8220;the Manor house
wants lead lights in some of the windows&#8221; suggests an
unparalleled anachronism, since the term &#8220;lead
light&#8221; is an ancient one referring to casement sashes
of leaded glass. But it is inconceivable, in the context
of colonial architectural history, that this house
should have had leaded-casement windows, and it is
very probable, therefore, that the semiliterate Oliver
was indulging in a rural archaism to which he
had transferred the meaning of &#8220;sash lights.&#8221; The
latter term was used commonly to denote double-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>hung,
wooden-sash windows, such as Georgian houses
still feature. In support of this inference is the
complete lack of archeological evidence of leaded-glass
windows.</p>

<p>The cellarless areas of the foundation may have
provided the footings for chimneys. These probably
stood several feet from the ends, perhaps serving
clusters of four corner fireplaces each, for each floor.
One may surmise that there was a hip roof, with a
chimney rising through each hip. A porch at the
north end had a rectangular brick base 4 by 6 feet,
surrounded by a flagstone area 16 feet wide and
8 feet 5 inches in extent from the house. This evidence,
however, differs from the figures given in the
insurance plan which shows a &#8220;Porch 8 by 6 feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mansion embodied some characteristics which
are traditional in Virginia house design and others
which are without parallel. The elongated plan indicated
by the foundation was more frequently encountered
in Virginia dwellings of the late 17th and
early 18th centuries than in the &#8220;high Georgian&#8221;
mansions of the 1740&#8217;s and 1750&#8217;s. Turkey Island,
for example, built in Henrico County in the 17th
century, was 103 feet long, 5 feet less than Marlborough.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
The additions to Governor Berkeley&#8217;s
Green Spring Plantation, built during the late 17th
century, consisted of an informal series of rooms, one
room in depth for the most part. Waterman is of the
opinion that Green Spring was &#8220;in a sense an overgrown
cottage without the real attributes of a mansion.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
The excavations conducted in 1954 by
Caywood have altered the basis for this opinion somewhat,
but, with its 150-foot length, Green Spring
remains an early example of the elongated plan.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Aside from being elongated, Marlborough derives
from the ubiquitous informal brick cottage of Virginia.
So indigenous is this vernacular form that it is often
found in houses of considerable pretension, even in the
18th century. Such are the Abingdon glebe house in
Gloucester County, Gunston Hall in Fairfax, and the
Chiswell Plantation, known as &#8220;Scotchtown,&#8221; in
Hanover. Robert Beverley noted the Virginians&#8217;
fondness for this style, commenting that they built
many rooms on a floor because frequent high winds
would &#8220;incommode a towering Fabrick&#8221;&mdash;an explanation
as delightful as it is absurd.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>That these one-story houses could be completely
formal is demonstrated in the unique early 18th-century
addition to Fairfield (Carter&#8217;s Creek Plantation)
in Gloucester County, which burned in 1897.
This dwelling had a full hip roof, with dormers to
light the attic rooms, and a high basement. Its
classical cornice was bracketed with heavy modillions,
while a massive chimney protruded from the slope of
the hip.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Gunston Hall, on the other hand, reverted
to the gable-end form. Although essentially a Virginia
cottage, it is richly adorned with Georgian architectural
detail. Completed in 1758, only eight years
after Marlborough, and owned by Mercer&#8217;s nephew
George Mason, this building may be more closely
related to Marlborough than any other existing
house.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

ed., 3rd edition, corrected, London, 1742). Palladio&#8217;s was one of the works
owned by Mercer and probably used by Bromley. The arcaded loggias of
the one-story wings of this building may have contributed to the inspiration
of Marlborough. (<i>Courtesy of the Library of Congress.</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>Of all the one-story Virginia houses that have come
to our attention, only Marlborough has a full-length
veranda. To be sure, there are multiple-story houses
with full-length verandas, the most notable being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Mount Vernon. Elmwood, built just before the
Revolution in Essex County, is another, having a
foundation plan similar to Marlborough&#8217;s.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The
Mount Vernon veranda is part of the remodeling of
1784, so that neither house reached its finished state
until a quarter of a century after Marlborough&#8217;s
completion. Marlborough may thus at the outset
have been unique among Virginia dwellings in having
such a veranda. However, full-length verandas on
buildings other than dwellings were not unknown in
Virginia prior to the construction of Marlborough,
for they occurred in an almost standard design in the
form of arcaded loggias in county courthouses.
Typical were King William and Hanover County
courthouses, both built about 1734 (<a href="#Fig_5">figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig_61">61</a>).</p>

<p>The arcaded loggia is Italian in origin and is traceable
here to Palladio, whose influence was diffused to
England and the colonies in a variety of ways. We
know that <i>The Architecture of A. Palladio</i> was one
of four architectural works acquired by Mercer in
1748 and apparently lent to his &#8220;architect,&#8221; joiner
William Bromley. The direct influence of this work
on the overall plan of Marlborough probably was
negligible. However, Palladio illustrates the villa of
&#8220;the magnificent Lord Leonardo Emo&#8221; at &#8220;<i>Fanzolo</i>,
in the <i>Trevigian</i>&#8221; (<a href="#Fig_45">fig. 45</a>), which may have caught
Mercer&#8217;s eye. This building had a central, raised
pavilion with two one-story wings, each approximately
100 feet long. Each wing had a full-length,
arcaded veranda. The wings were intended for
stables, granaries, and so forth. Palladio commented:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>"People may go under shelter every where about this
House, which is one of the most considerable conveniences
that ought to be desir&#8217;d in a Country-house."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mercer may have been impressed by this argument
and by the arcade in the design. He was already
familiar with arcades at the capitol at Williamsburg
and at the College of William and Mary, as well as
at outlying courthouses where he practiced, the
courthouse at Stafford probably included. In any
case, he did not have the veranda built until 1748 or
1749, after the main structure had been completed.
It is significant, in this regard, that it was not until
March 1748 that he settled accounts with Sydenham
&amp; Hodgson for the four architectural books (including
Palladio).</p>

<p>A formal garden apparently was laid out in the
nearly square, walled enclosure behind the mansion.
It is perhaps wholly a coincidence that Palladio,
writing about the villa at Fanzolo, commented, &#8220;On

<h3>XI<br />
<br />
<i>Kitchen Foundation</i><br />
(<i>Structure E</i>)</h3>


<p class="title">DESCRIPTION OF EXCAVATIONS</p>

<p>Structure E was a brick foundation, 17 feet by 32
feet, situated at the northwest corner of the enclosure-wall
system. Its south wall was continuous with Wall
D, which joined it, and was at right angles to Wall E.
The latter abutted it in line with an interior foundation
wall which bisected the structure into two room
areas, designated X and Y. Thus it once stood like a
bastion extending outside the enclosure walls, but
remaining integral with them and affording a controlled
entrance to the enclosure (<a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p>The east end of Structure E extended under a modern
boundary fence to the present edge of the highway.
Ditching of the highway had cut into the foundation
and exposed the debris and slabs of stone in place,
which indeed had provided the first clues to the
existence of the structure. Clearance of the easterly
area, Room X, revealed a pavement of roughly
rectangular slabs of mixed Aquia-type lime-sandstone
and red sandstone. These slabs were flaked,
eroded, and discolored, as though they had been exposed
to great heat. The pavement was not complete,
some stones having apparently been removed.
The scattered locations of the stones remaining <i>in
situ</i> implied that the entire room was originally
paved.</p>

<p>Between the northwest corner of Room X and a
brick abutment 5 feet to the south was a rectangular
area where the clay underlying the room had been
baked to a hard, red, bricklike mass (<a href="#Fig_49">fig. 49</a>). Wood
ash was admixed with the clay. This was clearly the
site of a large fireplace, where constant heat from a
now-removed hearth had penetrated the clay. Extending
north 3.8 feet beyond the bounds of the room
at this point was a U-shaped brick foundation 4.75
feet wide. Near the southeast corner of the room,
just outside of the foundation, which it abutted, was a
well-worn red-sandstone doorstep, which located the
site of the door communicating between Structure E
and the interior of the enclosure&mdash;and, of course,
between Structure E and Structure B, the distance
between which was 100 feet.</p>

<p>Room Y, extending west beyond the corner of the
enclosure walls was perhaps an addition to the original
structure. The disturbed condition of the bricks
where this area joined Room X, however, obscured
any evidence in this respect. In the northeast corner,
against the opposite side of the fireplace wall in Room
X, was another area of red-burned clay. Lying across
this was a long, narrow slab of wrought iron, 34.5 by
6 inches (<a href="#Fig_50">fig. 50</a>), which may have served in some
fashion as part of a stove or fire frame. In any case,
a small fireplace seems to have been located here.
Approximately midway in the west wall of Room Y,
against the exterior, lay a broken slab of red sandstone,
which obviously also served as a doorstone.
That it had been designed originally for a more
sophisticated purpose is evident in the architectural
treatment of the stone, which is smoothly dressed with
a torus molding along each edge and a diagonal cut
across one end (<a href="#Fig_41">fig. 41</a>). No evidence of floor remained
in this room, except for a smooth surface of
yellow clay which became sticky when exposed to rain.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 47.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Foundation</span> of Structure E (kitchen).</span>
</div>

<p>The north half of Room Y was filled with broken
bricks, mortar, plaster, nails, and&mdash;significantly&mdash;small
bits of charred wood and burned hornets&#8217; nests.
The concentration of debris here could be explained
by the collapse of the chimney as well as the interior
wall into the room. The crumbly condition of the
southwest portion of the exterior-wall foundation also
may indicate a wall collapse. Few artifacts were
recovered in this area.</p>

<p>North of Room X lay a large amount of rubble and
artifacts, suggesting that the north wall had fallen
away from the building, perhaps carrying with it
shelves of dishes and utensils. Both rooms contained
ample evidence in the form of ash, charcoal, burned
hornets&#8217; nests, and scorched flagstones to demonstrate
that a fire of great heat had destroyed the building.</p>


<p class="title">ARCHITECTURAL DATA AND INTERPRETATION</p>

<p>John Mercer&#8217;s account with Thomas Barry (Ledger
G) itemizes for 1749, &#8220;building a Kitchen/ raising a
Chimney/ building an oven.&#8221; It is clear from the
features of Structure E, its relation to Structure B, and
the custom prevalent in colonial Virginia of building
separate dependencies for the preparation of food, that
Structure E was the kitchen referred to in Barry&#8217;s
account. Like this building, kitchens elsewhere were
almost invariably two rooms in plan&mdash;a cooking room
and a pantry or storage room. One of the earliest&mdash;at
Green Spring&mdash;had a large fireplace for the kitchen
proper, and in the second room a smaller fireplace,
both served by a central chimney. An oven stood inside
the building between the larger fireplace and the
wall.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> At Stratford (ca. 1725) the kitchen is similarly
planned, as it is at Mannsfield (Spotsylvania
County).<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Mount Vernon has an end chimney in its
kitchen, and only one fireplace. The floor of the
kitchen proper is paved with square bricks, while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103" name="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
second room has a clay floor. The Stratford kitchen
is paved with ordinary bricks. Such examples can be
multiplied several times.</p>

in foreground. (See <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88a</a>.)</span>
</div>

<p>The physical relationship of the kitchen to the main
house in Virginia plantations was dictated in part by
convenience and in part by the Palladian plans that
governed the architecture of colonial mansions.
Structure E&#8217;s relationship to Structure B is representative
of that existing between most kitchens and
their main buildings. Mount Vernon, Stratford,
Blandfield, Nomini Hall, Rosewell, and many other
plantations have, or had, kitchens located at points
diagonal to the house and on axes at right angles to
them. Usually each was balanced by a dependency
placed in a similar relationship to the opposite corner
of the house. Sometimes covered walkways connected
the pairs of dependencies, curved as at Mount Vernon,
Mount Airy, and Mannsfield, or straight as at Blandfield
in Essex County (1771). Marlborough, as we
shall see, was not typical in its layout, but the relationship
between kitchen and house was the customary
one.</p>

<p>The thickness of the foundations in Structure E was
the width of four bricks&mdash;approximately 17 inches.
As usual in the case of the lower courses of a foundation,
the bricks were laid in a somewhat random
fashion. The intact portions of the south and west
walls revealed corners of bricks laid end to end so as
to expose headers on both sides. The east wall showed
pairs of bricks placed at right angles to each other, so
that headers and stretchers appeared alternately. On
the north wall of Room X bricks were laid as headers
on the outside and as stretchers, one behind the other,
on the inside. These variations probably are due to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104" name="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
different bricklayers having worked on the building
simultaneously. Since oddly assorted courses would
have been below ground level, care for their appearance
was minimal. Finished exterior brickwork was
required only above the lowest point visible to the
eye.</p>

red clay, upon which fireplace hearth stood. Projecting foundation at left
may have supported an oven. Iron slab (see <a href="#Fig_50">fig. 50</a>) lies <i>in situ</i> with trowel
on top.</span>
</div>

<p>Brick sizes ran from 9 to 9&frac12; inches long, 4 to 4&frac12;
inches wide, and 2&frac14; to 2&frac34; inches thick. These measurements
are similar to those of bricks in the veranda
foundation and the added cellar cross wall of Structure
B. It is apparent from Ledger G that the elements
in Structure B, as well as the kitchen, were all built
by Thomas Barry. Barry probably used bricks that
he himself made, according to the custom of Virginia
bricklayers, so that the archeological and documentary
evidences of the extent of his work in the two
buildings reinforce each other.</p>

<p>The protruding rectangle of bricks at the north end
of Structure E resembles the foundation for steps in
Structure B. However, its position directly adjacent
to what must be assumed to have been the fireplace
precludes the possibility of its having been the location
for a step. Moreover, the pavement and doorstones
at the west and south demonstrate that the floor of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105" name="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the kitchen was at ground level, so that a raised step
at the north side would have been not only unnecessary,
but impossible.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 50.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wrought-iron slab</span>, found in Room Y, Structure E, behind
fireplace. Purpose unknown. Size, 6 by 35 inches.</span>
</div>

<p>We know from the ledger that Barry built an oven
and raised a chimney. That the latter was a central
chimney may be assumed on the basis of the evidence
of the two fireplaces placed back to back. There is,
however, no archeological evidence that there was
an oven within the structure, and every negative
indication that there was not. The rectangular protrusion,
exactly in line with the end of the fireplace
thus was apparently the foundation for a brick oven,
the domed top of which extended outside the building,
with its opening made into the north end of the
fireplace. Protruding ovens are known in New York
and New England, but none in Virginia has come
to the writer&#8217;s attention. On the other hand,
protruding foundations like the one here are also
unknown in Virginia kitchens, except where slanting
ground, as at Mount Vernon, has made steps
necessary.</p>

<p>It may be concluded that Structure E was the
plantation kitchen, that it was built in 1749, that it
had two rooms (a cookroom with fireplace paving and
a large fireplace, and a second room with a smaller
fireplace), that an oven built against the exterior of
the building opened into the north end of the fireplace,
and that the first, and probably the only, floor
was at ground level. Archeological evidence points
to final destruction of the building by fire. (Mercer
indicated that fire had threatened it previously in the
entry in his journal for April 22, 1765, which noted
&#8220;kitchen roof catch&#8217;d fire.&#8221;) In the form of datable
artifacts, it also shows that the structure was destroyed
in the early 19th century, since the latest ceramic
artifacts date from about 1800.</p>

<h3>XII<br />
<br />
<i>Supposed Smokehouse Foundation</i><br />
(<i>Structure F</i>)</h3>


<p class="title">DESCRIPTION OF EXCAVATIONS</p>

<p>A nearly square foundation, measuring 18.3 feet by
18.6 feet, with a narrow extended brick structure protruding
from it, was situated some 45 feet north of
Wall D, about midway in the wall&#8217;s length. It was
oriented on a north-northwest&mdash;south-southeast axis,
quite without reference to the wall system. The foundation
walls and the narrow extension were exposed
by excavation, but the interior area within the walls
was not excavated, except for 2-foot-wide trenches
along the edges of the walls.</p>

<p>The foundation itself, about 2 feet thick, consisted
of brick rubble&mdash;tumbled and broken bricks, not
laid in mortar and for the most part matching bricks
found elsewhere in Marlborough structures. Scattered
among the typical Virginia bricks and brickbats
were several distinctively smaller and harder dark-red
bricks measuring 7&frac14; inches by 3&frac12; inches (<a href="#Fig_53">fig. 53</a>).</p>

<p>The most interesting feature of the structure was its
narrow extension. This had survived in the form of
two parallel walls laid in three brick courses without
mortar, the whole projecting from the southeasterly
wall. The interior measurement between the walls
was 1.75 feet and the exterior overall width was 4
feet. Its southern extremity had an opening narrowed
to 1 foot in width by bricks placed at right angles to
the walls. Approximately 5 feet to the north the
passage formed by the walls was narrowed to 1 foot
by three tiers of one brick, each tier laid parallel to
the passage on each side. At 8.7 feet from its southern
terminus the extension intersected the main
foundation. Just north of this intersection, bricks
laid within the passage were stepped up to form a
platform two courses high and one course lower than
the top of the foundation. A fluelike opening was
formed by two rows of brick laid on top of the platform,
narrowing the passage to a width of 5 inches.
North of the southeast foundation wall there remained
a strip of four bricks in two courses at the level of the
opening, forming a thin continuation of the platform
for 3.25 feet.</p>


<p class="title">SIGNIFICANT ARTIFACTS IN STRUCTURE F</p>

<p>The narrow extension contained several bushels of
unburned oystershells and some coals. There was
limited evidence of burning, although the shells were
not affected by fire. A small variety of artifacts was
found, few of which dated later than the mid-18th
century. The flue or fire chamber yielded the following
artifacts:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>59.1717 Wine-bottle basal fragments, 5-5&frac12; inches, mid-18th-century form</p>

</div>

<p>Elsewhere, in the trenches next to the foundation
walls, artifacts typical of those occurring in other parts
of the site were found. Worth mentioning are pieces
of yellow-streaked, red earthen &#8220;agate&#8221; ware, sometimes
attributed to Astbury or Whieldon, and sherds
of cord-impressed Indian pottery.</p>


<p class="title">ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS</p>

<p>Since the interior of this structure was not excavated,
many uncertainties remain as to its identity. The
peculiar fluelike structure passing through its foundation,
the rubble of bricks used to form the foundation,
the huge quantities of oystershells in the flue,
with partly burnt coals underneath, give rise to
various speculations. So does the orientation of the
structure, which is off both the true and polar axes
and is also unrelated to the mansion or the wall
system.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation seems to be that Structure
F was the foundation of a smokehouse. A recently
excavated foundation in what was known as Brunswick
Town, North Carolina, is almost identical
(except for the use of ballast stone in the fire chamber
and the building foundation). This also is believed
to be a smokehouse foundation, since similar structures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109" name="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
are still remembered from the days of their use.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

inches. Perhaps one of the 630 bricks brought on the <i>Marigold</i> by Captain
Roger Lyndon and purchased by John Mercer.</span>
</div>

<p>The position of the Marlborough structure, outside
of the enclosure wall but not far from the kitchen,
the relative crudeness of its construction, and its off-axis
orientation, support the likelihood of its being a
utilitarian structure. The firing chamber and the
flue show unquestionably that it was a building
requiring heat or smoke. Marlborough had two
greenhouses, according to Thomas Oliver&#8217;s inventory,
and these would have required heating equipment.
But the small size of this structure and the absence of
any indication of tile flooring or other elaboration
suggested by contemporary descriptions of greenhouses
seem to rule out this possibility.</p>

<p class="title">STRUCTURE D</p>

<p>An exploratory trench was dug northward several
yards from a point on Wall D, on axis with Structure
B. An irregularly shaped remnant of unmortared-brick
structure, varying between two and three bricks
wide and one course high was discovered at the undisturbed
level. This measured 8.5 feet by 6 feet.
Adjacent to it, extending 5.8 feet and having a width
varying from 6.5 to 7 feet, was a pit 2 feet 8 inches
deep, dug 2 feet below the undisturbed clay level, and
filled with a heavy deposit of artifacts, oystershells,
and animal bones. The artifact remains were the
richest in the entire site. Some of the most significant

was probably the site of a privy, the remaining bricks

<p class="title">STRUCTURE G</p>

<p>A few feet southeast of Structure D, another much
smaller pit was found, surrounded on two sides by a
partial-U-shaped single row and single course of
bricks. This brickwork measured 5 feet in length,
with a 4-foot appendage at one end and a 7-foot
appendage at the other. The pit was small and
shallow. Typical ceramic artifacts were found, as
well as fragments of black basaltes ware (<a href="#Dr_32">ill. 32</a>) and
some early 19th-century whiteware. The function
of this pit is unknown.</p>


<p class="title">PIT AT JUNCTION OF WALLS A-II AND D</p>

<p>Just north of the northeast corner of the wall system

small, ceramic-tableware fragments, and
about one-third of a blue-and-white Chinese porcelain
plate (<a href="#Fig_55">figs. 55</a> and <a href="#Fig_77">77</a>).</p>

<p>About 60 feet from the shore of Potomac Creek, at
the southeast corner of the old road that runs from
the highway to the creek, bordered by Wall A, were
indications of a brick foundation. This structure was
explored to the extent of its width (about 15 feet) for
a distance northward of 17 feet, then the east wall
was traced 22 feet farther north until it disappeared
into the bankside and a thicket. The excavated area
disclosed quantities of brickbats, a layer of soil, a
number of burnt bricks, a layer of black charcoal ash,
and a 6-inch deposit of clay. The brick walls were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113" name="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a><br /><a id="Page_114" name="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
1.5 feet thick. The structure had been built into the
hillside, so that the north end was presumably a deep
basement.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 57.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Structure H</span>, from Potomac Creek shore, looking northeast.</span>
</div>

<p>Artifacts were few. A complete scythe (<a href="#Fig_90">fig. 90</a>) was
found embedded in the clay above the brickwork on
the east side of the structure, and next to it a large
body sherd of black-glazed Buckley ware. A few
small ceramic sherds occurred&mdash;pieces of redware
with trailed slip (<a href="#Fig_64">fig. 64</a>), and small bits of delft,
salt glaze, and Chinese porcelain.</p>

<p>The location and implied shape of the building
suggest that it had a utilitarian purpose. Near the
waterfront, it would conveniently have served as a
warehouse, or possibly as either the brewhouse or
malthouse, each described by Mercer as having been
100 feet long, of brick and stone. Whether one was
of brick and the other of stone, or both were brick and
stone in combination, is not clear. There was no
evidence of stonework in Structure H. On the other
hand, the 100-foot-long rectangular stone enclosure,
of which Wall A formed a part, shows no evidence
of brickwork. The purposes of both these structures
must, for now, remain unexplained, but association
with the brewery seems plausible.</p>

<i>Stafford Courthouse
South of Potomac Creek</i></h3>


<p class="title">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>The chief archeological problem of Marlborough
at the time of excavation was whether or not Structure
B had served as the foundation for both the courthouse
and for John Mercer&#8217;s mansion. Although the
possibility still remains that the sites of the two buildings
overlapped, preceding chapters have demonstrated
that the foundation was constructed by Mercer for his
house, and that it did not stand beneath the courthouse.</p>

<p>However, in 1957 it was thought that exploration
of the late-18th-century courthouse site, located upstream
on the south side of Potomac Creek, might
reveal a structure of similar dimensions which would
help to confirm the possibility that Structure B had
originated with the Marlborough courthouse. Furthermore,
the Potomac Creek site was of interest by
itself and was closely related to John Mercer&#8217;s legal
and judicial career.</p>

<p>The location of the site is depicted in surveys included
with suit papers of 1743 and 1805.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> These
papers were brought to our attention by George H. S.
King of Fredericksburg, and were mentioned in
Happel&#8217;s carefully documented history of the Stafford
and King George courthouses.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Previously, we had
been led to the site by a former sheriff of Stafford
County, who recalled listening as a boy to descriptions
of the old courthouse building by an ancient whose
memory went back to the early years of the 19th
century. The old man&#8217;s recollections, in turn, were
reinforced by similar recountings of elders in his own
youth. Unscientific though the value of such information
may be, it emerges from folk memories that often
remain sharp and clear in rural areas, spanning in the
minds of two or three individuals the periods of several
conventional generations. As clues, at least, they are
never to be ignored. In this case we were taken to a
rubble-strewn site on an eminence that overlooks
Potomac Creek. At the foot of a declivity below, on
the old Belle Plains road, we were shown another
obvious evidence of structure, which we were told
had been the jail. Just to the east of this where a
road leads away to the site of Cave&#8217;s tobacco warehouse
(now the &#8220;Stone Landing&#8221;), we were informed
that the stocks had once stood.</p>

<p>Of the latter two sites we have no confirming
evidence, although both claims are plausible enough.
No archeological effort was made to investigate them,
since funds were limited. The surveys of 1743 and
1805 are sufficient to confirm with accuracy the courthouse
site. Accordingly, an archeological exploration
was made between August 19 and August 23, 1957,
revealing unmistakably the footings of a courthouse.
As will be shown, these footings in no way bore a
resemblance to the Structure B foundation.</p>


<p class="title">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</p>

<p>The history of the Potomac Creek courthouse site
has been presented thoroughly by Happel, but a brief
review is in order here. Happel shows that a courthouse
was ordered built in 1665, a year after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116" name="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a><br /><a id="Page_117" name="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
establishment of Stafford as a county. He quotes a
court reference in 1667 to the road along the south
shore of Potomac Creek, running from the &#8220;said
Ferry,&#8221; near the head of the Creek, &#8220;to the Court
house to the horse Bridge,&#8221; which he identifies as
having spanned Passapatanzy Gut. In his opinion,
this courthouse was near the mouth of the Creek, but
he fails to show that it equally well may have been
near the site of the later 18th-century structures.</p>

location of Stafford courthouse south of Potomac Creek.</span>
</div>

<p>We have seen that in 1690 court was first held in
Thomas Elzey&#8217;s house, seemingly located near the
18th-century courthouse site, and that orders were
given that it continue to meet there until the new
courthouse was ready. The history of the new courthouse
at Marlborough has already been recounted,
its final demise occurring about 1718. The court&#8217;s
official removal from Marlborough was agreed upon
July 20, 1720, and, as already noted, &#8220;the head of
Ocqua Creek&#8221; was designated for the new site,
although obviously by error, since Potomac Creek
plainly was intended.</p>

<p>Happel tells us that the Potomac Creek building
burned in 1730 or early 1731 and that the justices were
ordered on April 27, 1731, to rebuild at the same place.
It is this next building that was depicted on the 1743
survey plat (see <a href="#Fig_58">fig. 58</a>). In 1744 a bill was presented
in the Assembly to relieve persons who had suffered
or &#8220;may suffer&#8221; from the loss of Stafford County
records &#8220;lately consumed by Fire&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> apparently the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118" name="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
courthouse had again burned. There seems to have
been a delay of about five years in rebuilding it this
time. Pressures to relocate it were exerted in the
meanwhile and hearings were held by the Governor&#8217;s
Council on a petition to &#8220;remove the Court House
lower down.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The Council listened, then "Ordered,
that the new Court House be built where the
old one stood."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This settled, Nathaniel Harrison and Hugh Adie
contracted in 1749 with the justices of Stafford court
to build a &#8220;Brick Courthouse, for the Consideration
of 44500 lb. of Tobacco, to be furnished by the last of
October, 1750.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Harrison was a distinguished
member of the colony who, as a widower, had moved
to Stafford County the previous year and had married
Lucy, the daughter of Robert (&#8220;King&#8221;) Carter of
&#8220;Corotoman&#8221; and widow of Henry Fitzhugh of
&#8220;Eagle&#8217;s Nest.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Harrison, who later built "Brandon"
for himself in King George County, probably
provided the capital and the materials, and perhaps
the design, of the courthouse. Adie, of whom nothing
is known, was doubtless the carpenter or bricklayer
who actually did the work.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 61.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hanover courthouse</span>, whose plan
dimensions correspond closely to the Stafford
foundation.</span>
</div>

<p>The construction was delayed by &#8220;many Disappointments,
and the Badness of the Weather.&#8221;
Finally, in the spring of 1751, it was about to be
brought to completion, &#8220;when it was feloniously burnt
to the Ground.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In April 1752 a special act was
passed in order to permit a levy to be made which
would allow the Stafford court to reimburse Harrison
and Adie for the amount of work which they had
accomplished on the courthouse and the value of the
materials they had provided.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>No record exists of the contract for the next&mdash;and
last&mdash;courthouse building on the Potomac Creek
site. Quite possibly Harrison and Adie again did the
work. This building was used until removal of the
court to a new building completed between 1780 and
1783 on a site near the present Stafford courthouse.
It remained standing throughout most of the 19th
century, according to local memory. In surveys of
1804 and 1805 the structure was identified as the
&#8220;old court house.&#8221;</p>


<p class="title">DESCRIPTION OF EXCAVATIONS</p>

<p>Excavations were conducted in the simplest manner
possible, in order to arrive at the objective of determining
the dimensions of the courthouse without
exceeding available funds. An exploratory trench
soon exposed a line of rubble and disturbed soil. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119" name="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
line was followed until the entire outline of the building
was revealed. At several points bricks in mortar
still remained <i>in situ</i>, especially at the south end.
Two brick piers extended 4 feet 5 inches into the
structure, midway along the south wall at a distance
of 5 feet 9 inches apart.</p>

<p>The emerging evidence indicated that the structure
was rectangular, approximately 52 feet long and 26
feet wide, with a T-shaped projection 25 feet wide
extending out a distance of 14 feet 5 inches from the
center of the east wall of the building.</p>


<p class="title">SIGNIFICANT ARTIFACTS ASSOCIATED
WITH POTOMAC CREEK COURTHOUSE</p>

<p>Few artifacts occurred in the small area excavated
at the courthouse site. Those which did, significantly,
related either to the structure itself or to the eating
and drinking that probably occurred either alfresco
or within the courthouse building. We know that the
Ohio Company Committee met there for many years,
beginning in 1750, and doubtless lunches and refreshments
were served to the members during the
day, before they returned to the tavern or to neighboring
plantations to dine and spend the night.</p>

<p>Portions of wine bottles (of the same dimensions as
the Mercer &#8220;1737&#8221; bottle from Marlborough) were
found (<a href="#Dr_5">ill. 5</a>), along with small fragments of late 18th-century
types. A section of the rim of a large, octagonal,
white, salt-glazed-ware platter with a wreath
and lattice design was recovered from the north-wall
footings (<a href="#Dr_86">ill. 86</a>), and fragments of a salt-glazed-ware
dinner plate occurred in the south trench. An
oystershell found nearby suggests how the platter may
have been used. Two pieces of a white salt-glazed-ware
posset pot round out a picture of elegant eating
and drinking in the 1760&#8217;s, as do the fragments of
polished, agate octagonal-handled knives and forks.
The latter were badly damaged by fire.</p>

<p>Pieces of blue-and-white delft punch bowls were
found, as well as a sherd of polychrome delft which
dated apparently from 1740 to 1760. Two sherds of
creamware plates with wavy edges in the &#8220;Catherine&#8221;
shape reflect the last years of official use of the courthouse.
A tantalizing find is a small fragment of
cobalt-blue glass, blown in a mold to make panels or
oval indentations. This piece may have come from
a large bowl or sweetmeat dish.</p>

<p>Three sherds of black-glazed red earthenware are
the only evidence of utilitarian equipment. Pipe-stems
belong to the mid- and late-18th-century category.
A George II copper penny is dated 1746. A
large mass of pewter, melted beyond recognition, was
found near the south end of the structure. Bits of
charcoal are held within it. The pewter originally
may have been in the form of mugs or tankards.</p>

<p>Evidence of the structure is found in a large number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120" name="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a><br /><a id="Page_121" name="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of hand-forged nails, in quantities of window glass
melted and distorted, and in pieces of plaster. The
last is the typical hard, coarse oystershell plaster of
the area, having a smooth surface coat, except for
fine lines left by the trowel. There is no evidence of
paint. A small slide bolt of wrought iron probably
fitted on a cupboard door, or possibly the gate in
the bar (<a href="#Dr_87">ill. 87</a>). Another iron fixture is not identified.</p>

<p>Two kinds of window glass occurred. One, the
earliest type, is a thin, yellowish glass which is coated
with irridescent scale caused by the breakdown of
the glass surface. None of this glass shows signs of
fire or, at least, of melting. The remainder is a
grayish-blue aquamarine, much of it melted and
distorted, and some of it accumulated in thick masses
where tremendous heat caused the panes literally
to fold up. A fragment of yellowish-green glass pane,
related to the early type and again coated with scale,
varies in thickness and was apparently from a bullseye.
No evidence exists of diamond-shaped panes,
but, as should be expected, there is indication of
square-cornered panes in both types of glass.</p>


<p class="title">ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS</p>

<p>The plan of the footings (<a href="#Fig_60">fig. 60</a>) shows a T-shaped
foundation. This was an immediate clue to the
nature of the structure, for the T-shaped courthouse
was virtually a standard 18th-century form in Virginia.
This foundation, in fact, is almost a replica
of the plans of both King William and Hanover
County courthouses, each built about 1734<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> (<a href="#Fig_5">figs.
5</a>, <a href="#Fig_61">61</a>, and <a href="#Fig_62">62</a>).</p>

<p>The King William courthouse measures 50 feet
4&frac14; inches long and 26 feet 4 inches wide in the
main structure. Its T section extends 14 feet 9 inches
to the original end (to which an extension has been
added) and has a width of 23 feet 10&frac14; inches. The
Stafford foundation is 52 feet long and 26 feet wide
in the main structure. The T-section is 14 feet 5
inches long and 25 feet wide. A closer comparison
could scarcely be expected.</p>

<p>Hanover&#8217;s length is 52 feet 4&frac12; inches, the width of
the main section 27 feet 10 inches, while the T-section
is 15 feet 2&frac12; inches long (in its original part) and 26
feet 7 inches wide.</p>

<p>A third example, completed in 1736, is the Charles
City County courthouse.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The measurements of
this building are not available to us, but close examination
of photographs discloses a building of about
the same size.</p>

<p>The earliest of these T-shaped buildings thus far
recorded was the York County courthouse, completed
in 1733. Destroyed in 1814, its site has been excavated
by the National Park Service. Its foundation, measuring
59 feet 10 inches in length and 52 feet in full depth,
including the T, was somewhat larger than the others
known to us. The records show that it was rather
elaborate, with imported-stone floors and compass-head
windows.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>All these buildings had arcaded verandas. Marcus
Whiffen raises the question as to which of them, if
any, was the prototype, then concludes by speculating
that none was, and that all four may have derived
from the 1715 courthouse at Williamsburg, the dimensions
of which, however, remain unknown.
The introduction of the loggia first at the College of
William and Mary and then at the capitol led him to
postulate that its use in a courthouse also would have
originated in Williamsburg.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The Stafford foundation
showed no trace of stone paving where an arcade
might have been, but, since virtually all the bricks
had been taken away, it is likely that such a valuable
commodity as flagstones also would have been removed
as soon as the building was destroyed or dismantled.
Two brick piers at the west end of the
structure (<a href="#Fig_36">fig. 36</a>) remain a mystery. They are equidistant
from the longitudinal walls, and may have
been the foundations for a chimney. However, their
positions do not relate to the floor or chimney plans at
Hanover or King William courthouses, the other
features of which are so nearly comparable. One
would suppose every basic characteristic of the Stafford
building would have been the same as in these
buildings. The piers were perhaps late additions or
modifications.</p>

<p>The roof was apparently of wood; there were no
evidences of slate shingles. The bricks were approximately
8&frac12; inches by 4 inches by 2&frac34; inches, and were
probably laid in a patterned Flemish bond, as at
Hanover or King William, since some of the bricks
were glazed. No lead or other signs of &#8220;calmes&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122" name="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
used in leaded sash were found, so we must assume
that the 1665 courthouse was built elsewhere.</p>


<p class="title">CONCLUSION</p>

<p>It may be assumed that the Potomac Creek courthouse,
which was built of brick, resembled the
courthouses of Hanover, King William, and Charles
City, and that its architecture, symbolizing the
authority of Virginia&#8217;s government, reflected the
official style expressed in the government buildings at
Williamsburg. All the successive Stafford courthouses
from 1722 on probably were built on the old foundations;
if so, the Stafford building was the earliest T-form
courthouse yet known in Virginia. Its similarity
to the three structures built in the 1730&#8217;s shows that
an accepted form had developed, possibly, as Whiffen
suggests, deriving from a prototype in Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The courthouse bears no resemblance, either in its
shape or the absence of a basement, to the Structure B
foundation at Marlborough. The site, reached more
easily than Marlborough from any direction, dictated
the removal to it of the courthouse in 1722, thus
contributing to the demise of Marlborough as a town.
The last structure, especially, was historically important
because of the meetings of the Ohio Company
held in it. It is of particular interest to the
story of Marlborough because John Mercer was, for
most of its existence, the senior justice of the Stafford
court.</p>

<i>Ceramics</i></h3>

<p>Most of the ceramic artifacts found at Marlborough
can be dated within John Mercer&#8217;s period of occupancy
(1726-1768). A meager scattering of late
18th- and early 19th-century whitewares and stonewares
reflects the John Francis Mercer and Cooke
ownerships (1768-1819).</p>


<p class="title">COARSE EARTHENWARE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tidewater type.</span>&mdash;Mercer&#8217;s purchase in 1725 of £12
3s. 6d. worth of earthenware from William Rogers
(p. 16, footnote 54) probably was made for trading
purposes, judging from the sizable cost. Rogers operated
a stoneware and earthenware pottery in Yorktown,
which evidently was continued for a considerable
time after his death in 1739.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> An abundance of
waster sherds (unglazed, underfired, overfired, or
misshapen fragments cast aside by the potter), supposedly
from Rogers&#8217; output, has been found as street
ballast and fill in Yorktown and its environs. Microscopic
and stylistic comparison with these sherds
relates numerous Marlborough sherds to them in
varying degrees. For purposes of tentative identification,
the ware will be designated &#8220;Tidewater type.&#8221;
Some of the ware may have been produced in Rogers&#8217;
shop, while other articles resembling the Yorktown
products may have been made of similar clay and fired
under conditions comparable to those at Yorktown.</p>

<p>A Marlborough milk pan (USNM 59.1961, <a href="#Dr_11">ill. 11</a>,
and USNM 59.1580) has a salmon-colored body and
a lustrous mahogany glaze with fine manganese
streaking. Another milk pan (USNM 59.2039, <a href="#Dr_2">ill. 2</a>,
<a href="#Fig_63">fig. 63a</a>) has a buff body and a glaze of uneven thickness
that ranges in color from thin brown with black
flecking to a glutinous dark brown approaching black.
The most typical glaze color, influenced by the underlying
predominant pinkish-buff body, is a light
mahogany with black specks or blotches. It occurs at
Marlborough on a small sherd (USNM 60.201). A
variant glaze occurring on pottery found in Yorktown
appears here in a yellowish-buff sherd flecked with
black (USNM 60.154). The flecking is only in part
applied with manganese; it is also the effect of
ocherous and ferruginous particles which protrude
through the surface of the body, assuming a dark
color. Occasionally the manganese is spread liberally,
so that the natural body color shows through only as
flecks in a reverse effect (USNM 59.1855); now and
then the vessel is uniformly black (USNM 60.141).</p>

<p>Tidewater-type forms found at Marlborough include
milk pans 15 inches in diameter and about 4&frac14;
inches deep (in 1729 Mercer bought &#8220;2 milk pans&#8221;
for 5d. and 5 &#8220;gallon basons&#8221; for 4s. 7d.), a black-glazed
jar cover with indicated diameter of 6&frac12;
inches (USNM 59.2013), and fragments of other pans
and bowls of indeterminate sizes. A portion of an ale
mug has a tooled base and black glaze (USNM
59.2043, <a href="#Fig_63">fig. 63d</a>, <a href="#Dr_12">ill. 12</a>). Its diameter is 3&#8538; inches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molded-rim type.</span>&mdash;This is a type of redware with
a light-red body and transparent, ginger-brown lead
glaze. It is characterized by a rolled rim and a tooled
platform or channel above the junction of rim and
side. A small number of pan and bowl rims was
found at Marlborough. The ware is usually associated
with early 18th-century materials from such sites<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126" name="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
as Jamestown, Kecoughtan, Williamsburg, and Rosewell.
It may have originated in England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">North Devon gravel-tempered ware.</span>&mdash;The coarse
kitchenware made in Bideford and Barnstaple and in
the surrounding English villages of North Devon is
represented by only two sherds. This ware is characterized
by a dull, reddish-pink body, usually dark-gray
at the core, and by a gross waterworn gravel
temper. It occurs in contexts as early as 1650 at
Jamestown and as late as 1740-1760 at Williamsburg.
One of the Marlborough sherds is part of a large pan.
It is glazed with a characteristic amber lead glaze
(USNM 60.202). The other sherd is a portion of an
unglazed handle, probably from a potlid (USNM
59.1679, <a href="#Dr_15">ill. 15</a>).<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Slip-lined redware.</span>&mdash;Numerous 18th-century sites
from Philadelphia to Williamsburg have yielded a
series of bowls and porringers characterized by interior
linings of slip that is streaked and mottled with
manganese. These are glazed on both surfaces, the
outer surface and a border above the slip on the inner
surface usually ginger-brown in color. Comparative
examples are a bowl from the Russell site at Lewes,
Delaware, dating from the first half of the 18th
century, and several pieces from pre-Revolutionary
contexts at Williamsburg. A deposit excavated by
H. Geiger Omwake near the south end of the Lewes
and Rehoboth Canal in Delaware included sherds
from a context dated late 17th- to mid-18th centuries.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
Several fragments of bowls occur in the
Marlborough material (USNM 59.1613, 59.1856,
<a href="#Fig_64">fig. 64g</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English yellowware.</span>&mdash;The few sherds of so-called
combed ware occurring at Marlborough, although
only the base fragments connect, all seem to have
come from a single cup or posset pot having a buff
body and characteristically decorated with spiraled
bands of dark-brown slip that were created by combing
through an outer coating of white slip, revealing
an underlayer of red slip. The vessel was glazed
with a clear lead glaze (USNM 59.1700, <a href="#Fig_64">fig. 64c</a>, <a href="#Dr_16">ill. 16</a>).
Comparative dated examples of this ware include a
posset pot dated 1735.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> A chamber pot bearing
the same kind of striping was excavated by the National
Park Service at Fort Frederica, Georgia (1736-ca.
1750). A piece similar to that from Marlborough
was found in the Rosewell deposit, and another in
the Lewis Morris house site, Morrisania, New York.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Although this type of ware was introduced in England
about 1680, its principal use in America seems to
have occurred largely between 1725 and 1775.
Archeological evidence is corroborated by newspaper
advertisements. In 1733 the <i>Boston Gazette</i> advertised
&#8220;yellow ware Hollow and Flat by the Crate&#8221; and
again in 1737 &#8220;yellow and Brown Earthenware.&#8221;
In 1763 the <i>Gazette</i> mentioned &#8220;Crates of Yellow
Liverpool Ware,&#8221; Liverpool being the chief place of
export for pottery made in Staffordshire, the principal
source for the combed wares.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buckley ware.</span>&mdash;I. Noël Hume has identified a
class of high-fired, black-glazed earthenware found
in many 18th-century sites in Virginia. He has
done so by reference to <i>The Buckley Potteries</i>,
by K. J. Barton,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and to waster sherds in his
possession from the Buckley kiln sites in Flintshire,
North Wales. The ware probably was made in other
potteries of the region also. This durable pottery,
more like stoneware than earthenware, is represented
by a large number of jar and pan fragments. Two
body types occur, each characterized by a mixture of
red and buff clay. In the more usual type the red
clay dominates, with laminations and striations of
buff clay running through it in the manner of a coarse
sort of agateware. The other is usually grayish buff
with red streaks, although sometimes the body is almost
entirely buff, still showing signs of lamination. The
glaze is treacly black, often applied unevenly and
sometimes pitted with air bubbles. The body surfaces
have conspicuous turning ridges. Rims are usually
heavy and flat, sometimes as wide as 1&frac12; inches. A
variant of the ware is represented in a milk pan with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127" name="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a><br /><a id="Page_128" name="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
dominantly red body which has a clear-amber, rather
than black, glaze. (USNM 59.1887, <a href="#Dr_17">ills. 17</a>, <a href="#Dr_18">18</a>, and
<a href="#Dr_19">19</a> and <a href="#Fig_65">fig. 65</a>).</p>

<p class="title">STONEWARE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhenish stonewares.</span>&mdash;The stoneware potters who
worked in the vicinity of Grenzhausen in the Westerwald
in a tributary of the Rhine Valley held a far-flung
market until the mid-18th century. It was not
until the Staffordshire potters brought out their own
salt-glazed whitewares that the colorful blue-and-gray
German products suffered a decline. Before that,
Rhenish stonewares were widely used in England and
the colonies; those for the British market frequently
were decorated with medallions in which the reigning
English monarch&#8217;s initial appeared. Elaborate incising
and blue-cobalt coloring gave a highly decorative
character to the ware, while salt thrown into the
kiln during the firing combined with the clay to provide
a hard, clean surface matched only by porcelain.</p>

<p>John Mercer, like so many of his fellow colonials,
owned Westerwald stoneware. From Ledger G, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130" name="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a><br /><a id="Page_131" name="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
know that in 1743 he bought &#8220;2 blew &amp; W<sup>t</sup> Jugs 2/.&#8221;
From the artifacts it is clear that he not only had large
globose jugs, but also numerous cylindrical mugs and
chamber pots. A small group of sherds has a gray-buff
paste, more intricately incised than most.
Internally the paste surface is a light-pinkish buff.
These sherds are probably of the late 17th century,
or at least earlier than the predominantly gray wares
of the 18th century, which have hastily executed
designs.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Only two "GR" emblems (<i>Guglielmus</i>

Marlborough sherds. Admittedly, it is not possible
to distinguish with certainty the fragments of Yorktown
stoneware from their English counterparts.
Sherds of a pint mug, externally gray in the lower
half and mottled-brown in the upper, may be a
Yorktown product (USNM 59.1780, <a href="#Dr_22">ill. 22</a>). The

<p><span class="smcap">Nottingham-type stoneware.</span>&mdash;Several sherds of
stoneware of the type usually ascribed to Nottingham
appeared at Marlborough. This ware is characterized
by a smooth, lustrous, metallic-brown glaze.
The fragments are apparently from different vessels.
One is a foot rim of a posset pot or jug. Several body
sherds have fluting or paneling formed by molding,
with turning lines on the interior showing that the
molding was executed after the forms were shaped.
One sherd is decorated with shredded clay applied
before firing when the clay was wet. It appears to
come from the globose portion of a small drinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133" name="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
jug with a vertical collar. A handle section comes
from a pitcher or posset pot. Interior colors range
from a brownish mustard to a reddish brown. Nottingham
stoneware was made throughout the 18th
century,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> but these sherds correspond to middle-of-the-century

<p><span class="smcap">Drab stoneware.</span>&mdash;The dominant position attained
by the Staffordshire potters in the 18th century is due
to unremitting efforts to achieve the whiteness of
porcelain in their native products. Improvements in
stoneware were mostly in this direction, with the first
steps plainly evidencing what they failed to achieve.
One of the earlier attempts has a gray body coated
with white pipe-clay slip obtained at Bideford in
North Devon. This slip created the superficial
appearance of porcelain, as did tin enamel on the
surface of delftware. Although some Burslem potters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134" name="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
were making &#8220;dipped white stoneware&#8221; by 1710,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
it does not seem to have occurred generally until about
1725. Salt glaze was applied in the same manner as
on the earlier and coarser stonewares. Mugs in this
ware were banded with an iron-oxide slip, presumably
to cover up defects around the rims.</p>

</div>

<p>Several sherds of this drab stoneware were found at
Marlborough, including the base of a jug with curving
sides and pieces of tall mugs with brown rims (USNM
59.1893, <a href="#Fig_67">fig. 67b</a>, <a href="#Dr_25">ill. 25</a>). The body is characteristically
gray, while the slip, although sometimes dull
white, is usually a pleasant cream tone. Two sherds
were found beneath the flagstones around the north
porch of Structure B, where they probably fell before
1746 (USNM 59.1754).</p>

<p>One of the Burslem stoneware potters between 1710
and 1715 made what he called &#8220;freckled ware.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
Possibly this describes a sherd of a thin-walled mug
from Marlborough (USNM 59.1636) which is coated
with white slip inside and is finely speckled, or
&#8220;freckled,&#8221; in brown on the outside. Its body is the
gray of the drab stoneware, but with a high content of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135" name="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
micaceous and siliceous sand. Simeon Shaw, the
early 19th-century historian of the Staffordshire potteries,
asserted that what he called &#8220;Crouch&#8221; ware
was first made of brick clay and fine sand in 1690,
and by 1702 of dark-gray clay and sand.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Although
his dates are questioned by modern authorities, his
order of the progressive degrees of refinement in the
paste are acceptable as he suggests them. In respect
to the Marlborough sherd, although it is coarser than
the white-coated fragments described above, it answers
very well Shaw&#8217;s description of sandy-gray &#8220;Crouch&#8221;
ware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White salt-glazed ware.</span>&mdash;About 1720 calcined
flints were added to the body of the Staffordshire
stoneware, thus making possible a homogeneous white
body that did not require a coating of slip between
the body and the glazed surface.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> With this ware
the Staffordshire potters came closer to their goal of
emulating porcelain.</p>

<p>At Marlborough the earliest examples of this improved
ware are found in two sherds with incised
decorations that were scratched into the wet clay
(USNM 59.1819, <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67b</a>); the incised lines next
were filled with powdered cobalt before firing. This
technique is known as &#8220;scratch blue,&#8221; dated examples
of which, existing elsewhere, range from 1724 to 1767.
The body in the Marlborough specimens is still rather
drab, the whiteness of the later ware not yet having
been achieved. No slip was used, however, so that
the surface color is a pleasant pale gray. One sherd
is from a cup with a slightly flaring rim. The exterior
decoration is in the form of floral sprigs, while
the inside has a row of double-scalloped lines below
the rim. The other fragment is from a saucer.
Possibly the cup is part of Mercer&#8217;s purchase in 1742
of a dozen &#8220;Stone Coffee cups,&#8221; for which he paid 18d.
In Boston &#8220;White stone Tea-Cups and Saucers&#8221; were
advertised in 1745, and &#8220;blue and white ... Stone
Ware&#8221; in 1751.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>A later variant on the &#8220;scratch blue&#8221; is a class of salt-glazed
ware that resembles Westerwald stoneware.
Here loops, sworls, and horizontal grooves are scratched
into the paste. The cobalt is smeared more or less
at random, some of it lying on the surface, some running
into the incised channels. This style of decoration
was applied mostly to chamber pots but also to
small bowls and cups. Fragments of all these forms
occurred at Marlborough (<a href="#Fig_67">fig. 67c</a>).</p>

<p>After 1740 the body was greatly improved, resulting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136" name="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
in an attractive whiteware. Many wheel-turned
forms were produced, and these were liberally represented
at Marlborough in fragments of pitchers,
mugs, teapots, teacups, bowls, posset pots, and
casters (<a href="#Fig_67">fig. 67d</a>).</p>

<p>In the middle of the 18th century a process was
developed for making multiple plaster-of-paris molds
from brass or alabaster matrices<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and then casting
plates and other vessels in them by pouring in the
stoneware clay, diluted in the form of slip. The slip
was allowed to dry, and the formed utensil was
removed for firing. This molded salt-glazed ware
occurs in quantity in the Marlborough finds, suggesting
that there were large sets of it. One design predominates
in plates, platters, and soup dishes: wavy
edges, borders consisting of panels of diagonal lattices&mdash;with
stars or dots within the lattices framed in
rococo scrolls, and areas of basket-weave designs
between the panels. On a large platter rim the lattice-work
is plain, somewhat reminiscent of so-called
Chinese Chippendale design. The pattern is presumably
the design referred to in the <i>Boston News
Letter</i> for May 29, 1764: &#8220;To be sold very cheap.
Two or three Crates of white Stone Ware, consisting
chiefly of the new fashioned basket Plates and Oblong
Dishes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> One fragment comes from a cake plate
with this border design and a heavily decorated
center (<a href="#Fig_67">fig. 67e</a>).</p>

<p>Other molded patterns include gadrooning combined
with scalloping on a plate-rim sherd. A rim
section with molded rococo-scrolled edge is from a
&#8220;basket weave&#8221; sauceboat. Considerably earlier are
pieces of a pitcher or milk jug with a shell design
(USNM 59.1894, <a href="#Dr_27">ill. 27</a>). One rare sherd appears to
come from a rectangular teapot or tray. All the white
salt-glazed ware from Marlborough represents the
serviceable but decorative tableware of everyday use.
It must have been purchased during the last 10 years
of Mercer&#8217;s life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tin-enameled earthenware.</span>&mdash;The art of glazing
earthenware with opaque tin oxide and decorating
it with colorful designs was an Islamic innovation
which spread throughout the Mediterranean and
northward to Holland and England. Practiced in
England before the close of the 16th century, it
became in the 17th and the first half of the 18th
centuries a significant source of English tableware,
both at home and in America. Because of its close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137" name="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
similarity to the Dutch majolica of Delft, the English
version was popularly called &#8220;delftware,&#8221; even though
made in London, Bristol, or Liverpool.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, a minimum of tin-enameled wares
was found at Marlborough, with several sherds reflecting
the Port Town period. One of the latter
shows the lower portion of a heavy, dark-blue floral
spray, growing up, apparently, from a flowerpot. A
section of foot rim and the contour of the sherd
show that this was a 17th-century charger, probably
dating from about 1680 (USNM 60.177, <a href="#Fig_68">fig. 68a</a>).
The leaves are painted in the same manner as on a
Lambeth fuddling cup.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> A section of a plate with
no foot rim includes an inner border which encircles
the central panel design. It consists of two parallel
lines with flattened spirals joined in a series between
the lines. The glaze is crackled. This probably dates
from the same period as the preceding sherd (USNM
60.99, <a href="#Fig_68">fig. 68a</a>). Sherds from a larger specimen,
without decoration, have the same crackled enamel
(USNM 59.2059). There is also a fragment decorated
with small, blue, fernlike fronds, again suggesting
late 17th-century origin (USNM 59.1756, <a href="#Fig_68">fig. 68a</a>).
A small handle, the glaze of which has a pinkish cast,
is decorated with blue dashes, and probably was part
of a late 17th-century cup (USNM 59.1730, <a href="#Fig_68">fig. 68a</a>).</p>

<p>Several fragments of narrow rims from plates with
blue bands probably date from the first quarter of the
18th century. A reconstructed plate with the simplest
of stylized decoration was made at Lambeth about
1720 (USNM 59.1707, <a href="#Fig_69">fig. 69</a>). This plate has a
wavy vine motif around its upward-flaring rim, in
which blossoms are suggested by stylized pyramids of
three to four blocks formed by brush strokes about
&frac14;-inch wide, alternating with single blocks. The
central motif consists of two crossed stems with a
pyramid at each end and two diagonal, block brush
strokes intersecting the crossed stems. A large fragment
of a washstand bowl also has similar plain, block
brush strokes along a border defined by horizontal
lines&mdash;in this case a triplet of three strokes, one above
two, alternating with a single block. Edges of similar
brush strokes on the lower portion of the bowl remain
on the fragment. Garner shows a Lambeth mug
embodying this style of decoration combined with a
suggestion of Chinoiserie around the waist. He
ascribes to it a date of &#8220;about 1700,&#8221; although the
block-brush-stroke device, with variations, was practiced
until the 1760&#8217;s at Lambeth.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The Marlborough

<p>Another reconstructed plate, probably a Lambeth
piece, has blue decoration in the Chinese manner. It
dates from about 1730 to 1740 (USNM 59.1706, <a href="#Fig_70">fig.

from bowls, and none well enough defined to permit
identification.</p>

<p>There are several fragments of ointment pots, all
18th-century in shape. Three sherds of tin-enameled
redware are probably continental European. Two
of these have counterparts from early 17th-century
contexts at Jamestown. A blue-decorated handle
sherd from a large jug or posset pot is also 17th
century.</p>

<p>The predominance of early dating of tin-enamel
sherds and the relatively few examples of it from any
period suggest that much of what was found either was
used in the Port Town or was inherited by the Mercers,
probably by Catherine, and used when they were first
married. It also points up the fact that delftware
early went out of fashion among well-to-do families.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English fine earthenwares.</span>&mdash;The fine earthen
tablewares introduced in Staffordshire early in the
18th century, largely in response to the new tea-drinking
customs, are less well represented in the
Marlborough artifacts than are those made later in
the century. Apparently, the contemporary white
salt-glazed ware was preferred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marbled ware.</span>&mdash;The Staffordshire factories of
Thomas Astbury and Thomas Whieldon were
responsible for numerous innovations, including fine
&#8220;marbled&#8221; wares in which clays of different colors
were mixed together so as to form a veined surface.
The technique itself was an old one, but its application
in delicate tablewares was a novelty. Although
Astbury was the earlier, it was Whieldon who exploited
the technique after starting his potworks at
Little Fenton about 1740.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> From Marlborough
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139" name="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>come three meager sherds of marbled ware, probably
from three different vessels (USNM 59.1625, 59.1748,
59.1851). They are brownish red with white veining
under an amber lead glaze. A posset pot of these
colors in the Victoria and Albert Museum is supposed,
by Rackham, to date from about 1740.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black-glazed fine redware.</span>&mdash;Whieldon made a
black-glazed, fine redware, as did Maurice Thursfield
at Jackfield in Shropshire.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> A fragment of a black-glazed
teapot handle was found at Marlborough,
although the body is more nearly a hard grayish
brown than red (USNM 59.1638).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tortoiseshell ware.</span>&mdash;Cream-colored earthenware
was introduced as early as 1725, supposedly by Thomas
Astbury, Jr. It was not until the middle of the
century, however, that Whieldon began the use of
clouded glaze colors over a cream-colored body.
After 1756 Josiah Wedgwood became his partner
and helped to perfect the coloring of glazes. In 1759
Wedgwood established his own factory, and both firms
made tortoiseshell ware in the same molds used for
making salt-glazed whiteware.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> From Marlborough

<p>The Marlborough creamware sherds are all plain
(with one exception), consisting of fragments of wavy-edge
plates, bowls, and platters in Wedgwood&#8217;s
&#8220;Catherine shape,&#8221; introduced about 1770, as well as
mugs and pitchers (<a href="#Fig_72">fig. 72</a>). A piece of a large platter
has impressed in it the letters WEDG, running up to
the fracture. Below this is the number 1 (USNM
59.1997, <a href="#Fig_73">fig. 73</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitewares used in the Federal period.</span>&mdash;During
the late 1770&#8217;s Wedgwood introduced his &#8220;pearlware,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
in which the yellow cast of the cream body
was offset by a touch of blue. With the use of a nearly
colorless glaze that was still slightly bluish, it was now
possible to make a successful underglaze-blue decoration.
These whitewares were made in three principal
styles by Wedgwood&#8217;s many imitators, as well as by
Wedgwood himself. The most familiar of these styles
is the molded shell-edge ware, which was used in
virtually every place to which Staffordshire wares
penetrated after 1800. In a plain creamware version,
this was another Wedgwood innovation of about
1765.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> After 1780, the ware was white, with blue or
green borders. The Wedgwood shell-edge design has
a slightly wavy edge, and the shell ridges vary in
depth and length. At least one Leeds version has a
regular scalloped edge, like those found on several
other Marlborough sherds. In the 19th century the
ware became coarser and heavier, as well as whiter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142" name="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and in some cases the shell edge was no longer actually
molded but simply suggested by a painted border.
Some variants were introduced that were not intended
to be shell edge in design, but merely blue or green
molded patterns. A Marlborough sherd from one of
these has a gadrooned edge and molded swags and
palmettes. Except for two late rims, painted but not
molded, the shell-edge wares from Marlborough
probably date from John Francis Mercer&#8217;s period in
the late 1700&#8217;s and from John Bronaugh&#8217;s occupancy
of the mansion during the Cooke period in the first
decade of the 19th century (<a href="#Fig_74">fig. 74c</a>).</p>

<p>The success of the new whiteware in permitting the
use of underglaze blue resulted in a second class that
is decorated in the Chinese manner, after the style of
English delft and porcelain. This type was popular
between 1780 and 1790, especially in the United
States, where many whole specimens have survived
above ground. Several sherds are among the Marlborough
artifacts and appear to have come entirely
from hollow forms, such as bowls and pitchers.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Sherds from a blue-and-white mug with molded
designs, including the shell motif around the handle,
have been found also.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 77.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Blue-and-white</span> Chinese porcelain.</span>
</div>

<p>The third class of whiteware, which was heavily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143" name="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
favored in the export trade, consisted of a gay, hand-decorated
product, popular at the end of the 18th,
and well into the 19th, century. It had pleasing
variety, with floral designs in soft orange, green,
brown, and blue, often with brown or green borders.
A few examples of this later whiteware occur among
the Marlborough artifacts (<a href="#Fig_74">fig. 74b</a>). One sherd from
a small bowl is mottled in blue and touched with
yellow (USNM 59.1805, <a href="#Fig_74">fig. 74b</a>). Another is also
mottled, but in gray and blue. Such wares as the
latter were made by Hartley, Green &amp; Company at
Leeds before the factory&#8217;s demise in 1820 (USNM
59.1950, <a href="#Fig_74">fig. 74b</a>).<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>The transfer-printed wares that were so popular in
America after 1820 are represented by a mere eight
sherds, which is in accord with evidence that the
mansion house was unoccupied or destroyed after
1819. Of these sherds, only five can be dated before
1830. Two are pink, transfer-printed sherds of about
1835-45, and one is gray-blue, dating from about
1840-1850.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black basaltes ware.</span>&mdash;Another late 18th-century
innovation by Wedgwood, imitated by his competitors,
was a fine stoneware with a black body, called
black basaltes because of its resemblance to that
mineral. A few sherds of this were found at Marlborough.
Typically, they are glazed on the insides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144" name="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
only. They postdate John Mercer by twenty or
thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chinese porcelain.</span>&mdash;Oriental porcelain was introduced
to the English colonies at a very early date, as
we know from 17th-century contexts at Jamestown.
As early as 1725 John Mercer acquired &#8220;1 China
Punch bowl.&#8221; Presumably the &#8220;6 tea cups &amp;
Sawcers,&#8221; &#8220;2 chocolate cups,&#8221; and &#8220;2 custard cups&#8221;
obtained by him the same year were also porcelain.
Even before 1740, porcelain was occurring with increasing
frequency in America. We are told that in
1734, for example, it can be calculated that about
one million pieces of it left Canton for Europe.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Doubtless a large proportion was reexported to the
colonists. William Walker, Mercer&#8217;s undertaker for
the mansion, left at his death in 1750: &#8220;1 Crack&#8217;d
China bowl,&#8221; &#8220;1 Quart Bowl 6/, 1 large D<sup>o</sup> 12.6,&#8221;
&#8220;6 China cups &amp; Sawcers 5/,&#8221; and &#8220;12 China
plates 15/.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that 18th-century China-trade
porcelain sherds occurred with high incidence
at Marlborough. Mercer&#8217;s accounts show that he
acquired from Charles Dick in 1745 &#8220;1 Sett finest
China&#8221; and &#8220;2 punch bowls.&#8221; From the archeological
evidence it would appear that he had supplemented
this several times over, perhaps after 1750 in the
period for which we have no ledgers.</p>

<p>Most of the porcelain is blue and white. One
group has cloudy, blurred houses and trees, impressionistic
landscapes, and flying birds. This pattern
occurs in fragments of teacups, small bowls, and a
coffee cup. Another type has a border of diamonds
within diamonds, elaborate floral designs delicately
drawn, and a fine thin body. Similar sherds were
found at Rosewell. At Marlborough the design survived
in teacups, coffee cups, and saucers. There are
several additional border designs, some associated
with Chinese landscape subjects or human figures
(<a href="#Fig_76">figs. 76</a>, <a href="#Dr_24">ill. 24</a>, and <a href="#Fig_77">fig. 77</a>, <a href="#Dr_25">ill. 25</a>). A coarse type
with a crudely designed border hastily filled in
with solid blue is represented in a partly reconstructed
plate (USNM 60.122, <a href="#Fig_77">fig. 77</a>).</p>

<p>Polychrome porcelain is found in lesser amounts,
although in almost as much variety. Three sherds of a
very large punchbowl are decorated in red and blue.
Fragments of a small bowl have delicate red medallions
with small red and black human figures in their
centers. Fine borders occur in red and black. Gold,
yellow, and green floral patterns constitute another
class (<a href="#Fig_75">fig. 75</a>).</p>

<p>Almost all the porcelain is of high quality, probably
reaching a peak during Mercer&#8217;s middle and
prosperous years between 1740 and 1760. We
cannot expect to find any porcelain purchased after
his death in 1768, and certainly none appears to be
connected with the Federal period or with the so-called
&#8220;Lowestoft&#8221; imported in the American China
trade after the Revolution.</p>

<p class="title">BOTTLES</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Round beverage bottles.</span>&mdash;Bottles of dark-green
glass were used in the colonial period for wine, beer,
rum, and other potables. Although some wines and
liquors were shipped in the bottle, they were distributed
for the most part in casks, hogsheads, and
&#8220;pipes&#8221; before 1750. John Mercer recorded the
purchases of several pipes of wine&mdash;kinds unspecified&mdash;a
pipe being a large or even double-size hogshead.
He purchased rum by the gallon, in quantities that
ranged from 2 quarts in 1744 to &#8220;5 galls Barbadoes
Spirits&#8221; in 1745 and a &#8220;hhd 107&frac12; gall Rum&#8221; in 1748.</p>

<p>Bottles were used largely for household storage and
for the serving of liquors. They were kept filled in the
buttery as a convenience against going to the cellar
each time a drink was wanted. Bottles usually were
brought directly to the table,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> although the clear-glass
decanter was apparently regarded as a more
genteel dispenser. Mercer, like his contemporaries,
bought his own bottles, as when he purchased &#8220;2 doz
bottles&#8221; from John Foward in 1730. The previous
year he had acquired a gross of corks, which would
customarily have been inserted in his bottles and
secured by covering with cloth, tying around the lips
or string rings with packthread, and sealing with
warm resin and pitch.</p>

<p>Some wines were purchased in the bottle. In 1726
Mercer bought &#8220;2 doz &amp; 8 bottles Claret&#8221; and &#8220;1 doz
Canary&#8221; from Alexander McFarlane. In 1745 he
charged Overwharton Parish for &#8220;2 bottles Claret
to Acquia,&#8221; apparently for communion wine. Whether
all this was shipped from the vineyards in bottles,
or whether Mercer brought his own bottles to be filled
from the storekeepers&#8217; casks is not revealed.</p>

<p>An insight into the kinds of alcoholic drinks consumed
in Virginia in Mercer&#8217;s early period is given in the
official price-list for the sale of alcoholic beverages set
forth in the York County Court Orders in 1726:<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146" name="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>It will be noted that Bristol beer was sold by the
bottle, probably just as it was shipped, and &#8220;Fine
bottled Syder&#8221; apparently came in quart bottles.
Probably the wines were dispensed from casks in wine
measures. Mercer bought Citron water in bottles,
a half dozen at a time, as he did &#8220;Mint, Orange
flower &amp; Tansey D<sup>o</sup>,&#8221; in 1744.</p>

<p>Round beverage bottles ranged in shape from,
roughly, the form of a squat onion at the beginning of
the 18th century to narrow cylindrical bottles towards
the end of the century. The earliest bottles were free-blown
without the constraint of a mold, hence there
were many variations in shape. After about 1730
bottles were blown into crude clay molds which
imparted a roughly cylindrical or taper-sided contour
below sloping shoulders and necks. These marked
the first recognition of binning as a way of storing
wines in bottles laid on their sides. About 1750 the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147" name="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a><br /><a id="Page_148" name="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Bristol glasshouses introduced cylindrical brass
molds.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> From then on the problem of stacking bottles
in bins was solved and virtually all round beverage
bottles thenceforward were cylindrical with long necks.</p>

<p>At Marlborough the earliest form of wine bottle is
represented by a squat neck and a base fragment
(USNM 59.1717, <a href="#Dr_35">ill. 35</a>), both matching onion-shaped
bottles of the turn of the century, such as one
excavated at Rosewell (USNM 60.660). Except for
these fragments, the oldest form from Marlborough
may be seen in the complete bottle found in refuse
pit D (USNM 59.1688; <a href="#Fig_78">fig. 78</a>, <a href="#Dr_37">ill. 37</a>). This bottle
is typical of the transitional form, sealed examples of
which regularly occur bearing dates in the 1730&#8217;s.
Its sides are straight for about three inches above the
curve of the base, tapering slightly to the irregular
shoulder that curves in and up to a neck with wedge-shaped
string ring. Two inches above the base is a
seal, bearing the initials <span class="smcap lowercase">I&nbsp;<sup>C</sup>.M</span> above a decorative
device and the date 1737. The arrangement of
initials exactly matches that found on Mercer&#8217;s
tobacco-cask seals (<a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a> and <a href="#FN_89">footnote 89</a>) indicating
the &#8220;home plantation&#8221; at Marlborough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149" name="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Seals were applied by dropping a gather of glass on
the hot surface of a newly blown bottle, then pressing
into this deposit of glass a brass stamp bearing a
design, initials, date, etc. Three similar seals from
broken bottles also were found. The same arrangement
of initials, but with no date or device of any
kind, occurs on seven different seals (<a href="#Fig_79">fig. 79</a>, <a href="#Dr_36">ills. 36</a>
and <a href="#Dr_37">37</a>).</p>

<p>The diameter of the base of the sealed beverage
bottle is 5&frac12; inches, the widest diameter occurring on
any bottle fragments from Marlborough, excepting
the early specimen mentioned above. Bases in
gradually decreasing dimensions vary from this size
to 2&frac34; inches. Six bases run from 5 inches to 5&frac12;
inches; 11 are over 4&frac12; inches and up to 5 inches; 4 are
over 4 inches and up to 4&frac12; inches; 3 are over 3&frac12;
inches and up to 4 inches; none, except the smallest
of 2&frac34; inches, found in a mid-19th-century deposit, is
less than 3&frac34; inches.</p>

<p>Since beverage-bottle diameters diminished from
about 5 inches in the 1750&#8217;s and 1760&#8217;s to about 4
inches in the 1770&#8217;s and 1780&#8217;s and to 3&frac12; inches in
the 1790&#8217;s and early 1800&#8217;s, the peak of their incidence

Cider is said to have been put up in such bottles, and
it is also possible that brandies and liqueurs were
delivered in them. A quart-size bottle of this shape at
Colonial Williamsburg bears the seal &#8220;I. Greenhow

shipped in bottles of this shape, indications are that
the square bottles may have been used for other
purposes than holding gin. For one thing, Mercer&#8217;s
ledgers mention no purchases of gin. There is, in
fact, almost no evidence of the sale of gin in Virginia;
a single announcement of Holland gin available in
Williamsburg in 1752 is the exception until 1773,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151" name="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>

<p>A smaller base (USNM 59.1642) has a high kick-up,

<p><span class="smcap">Snuff bottles.</span>&mdash;Several items in Mercer&#8217;s ledgers
record the purchase of snuff, such as one for a "bottle
of snuff" in 1731 for 15d., another in 1743 for 3s.,
and a third in 1744 for 1s. 6d. Among the artifacts
is a partly restored bottle of olive-green glass, shaped
like a gin bottle but of smaller dimensions, with
a 2&frac14;-inch-wide mouth (USNM 59.1686, <a href="#Fig_81">fig. 81</a>).
The bottle is 3&frac34; inches square and 7 inches tall. It
has a low kick-up and a smooth pontil mark. Also
among the artifacts are a matching base and several
sherds of similar bottles.</p>

of his day. A round base from a greenish,
cylindrical bottle (USNM 59.2056) seems to represent
an Opadeldoc bottle. Another base is rectangular
with notched corners. The last, as well as the base
of a molded, basket-pattern scent bottle (USNM
59.2093) may be early 19th century in date. Other
medicine-bottle fragments are all 19th century, some
quite late (<a href="#Fig_82">fig. 82</a>).</p>


<p class="title">TABLE GLASS</p>

<p>A minimum of table-glass sherds was recovered,
and these were fragmentary. Glass is scarcely mentioned
in Mercer&#8217;s accounts, although there is no
reason to suppose that Marlborough was any less well
furnished with fine crystal than with other elegant
objects that we know about. Three sherds of heavy
lead glass have the thickness and contours of early
18th-century English decanters, matching more
complete fragments from Rosewell and a specimen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153" name="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a><br /><a id="Page_154" name="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>

</div>

<p>Several forms of drinking glasses are indicated. A
fragment of a foot from a long-stemmed cordial glass
shows the termini of white-enamel threads that were
comprised in a double enamel-twist stem. The twists
consisted of a spiral ribbon of fine threads near the
surface of the stem, with a heavy single spiral at the
core. The indicated diameter of the foot is 3&frac14; inches
(USNM 59.1761, <a href="#Dr_43">ill. 43</a>).</p>

<p>Fragments of large knops are probably from heavy
baluster wineglasses dating from Mercer&#8217;s early period
before 1750. A teardrop stem from a trumpet-bowl
wineglass has been melted past recognition in a fire.
The stem of a bucket-bowl cordial glass has suffered
in the same manner (USNM 59.1607). Still with
their shapes intact are two stems and base sections of
bucket-bowl wineglass. Two engraved bowl sherds
from similar-shaped cordial glasses and a rim sherd
from another engraved piece are the only fragments
with surface decoration (USNM 59.1634, 59.1864,
<a href="#Dr_45">ill. 45</a>). Several sherds of foot rims, varying in diameter,
were found, including one with a folded or
&#8220;welted&#8221; edge.</p>

<p>Tumblers, depending on their sizes, were used for
strong spirits, toddy, flip, and water. The base and
body sherds of a molded tumbler from Marlborough
are fluted in quadruple ribs that are separated by
panels &frac14;-inch wide (USNM 59.1864, <a href="#Fig_82">fig. 82c</a>, <a href="#Dr_46">ill. 46</a>).
Plain, blown tumbler bases have indicated diameters
of 3 inches.</p>

<p>A few unusual, as well as more typical, forms are
indicated by the Marlborough glass sherds. One small
fragment comes from a large flanged cover, probably
from a sweetmeat bowl or a posset pot. A specimen
of more than usual interest is a pressed or cast cut-glass
octagonal trencher salt (USNM 59.1830, <a href="#Fig_82">fig. 82a</a>,
<a href="#Dr_47">ill. 47</a>). This artifact reflects silver and pewter salt
forms of about 1725. A curved section of a heavy glass
rod is apparently from a chandelier, candelabrum, or
sconce glass (USNM 59.1696, <a href="#Fig_82">fig. 82e</a>). We have seen
that Mercer, in 1748, bought &#8220;1 superfine large gilt
Sconce glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although precise dates cannot be ascribed to any of
this glass, it all derives without much question from
the period of Mercer&#8217;s occupancy of Marlborough.</p>


<p class="title">MIRROR AND WINDOW GLASS</p>

<p>We know from the ledgers that there were sconce
and looking glasses at Marlborough. Archeological
refuse supplies us with confirmation in pieces of clear
lead glass with slight surviving evidence of the tinfoil
and mercury with which the backs originally were
coated. One piece (USNM 59.1693) has a beveled
edge <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide, characteristic of plate-glass wall
mirrors of the colonial period. A curved groove on
this piece, along which the fracture occurred, is probable
evidence of engraved decoration.</p>

<p>Window glass is of two principal types. One has a
pale-olive cast. A few fragments of this type have
finished edges, indicating that they are from the
perimeters of sheets of crown glass and that Mercer
purchased whole crown sheets and had them cut up.
It may be assumed that this greenish glass is the oldest,
perhaps surviving from Mercer&#8217;s early period.</p>

<p>The other type is the more familiar aquamarine
window glass still to be found in 18th-century houses.
A large corner of a rectangular pane has the slightly
bent contour of crown glass, which is the English type
of window glass made by blowing great bubbles of
glass which were spun to form huge discs. The discs
sometimes were cut up into panes of stock sizes and
then shipped to America, or else were sent in whole
sheets, to be cut up by storekeepers here or to be sold
directly to planters and other users of window glass
in quantity.</p>

<p>The centers of these sheets increased in thickness
and bore large scars where the massive pontil rods
which had held the sheets during their manipulation
were broken off. The center portions also were cut
into panes, which were used in transom lights and
windows where light was needed but a view was not.
Hence they served not only to utilize an otherwise
useless part of the crown-glass sheets, but also to
impart a decorative quality to the window. They are
still known to us as &#8220;bullseyes.&#8221; A piece of a bullseye
pane of aquamarine glass occurs in the Marlborough
finds. The pontil scar itself is missing, but the thick
curving section leaves little doubt as to its original
appearance. A similar fragment was found at
Rosewell.</p>

<i>Objects of Personal Use</i></h3>


<p>Costume accessories recovered at Marlborough are
extremely few. There are six metal buttons, all of
them apparently 18th century. One of flat brass
(USNM 59.2004) has traces of gilt adhering to the
surface; another of similar form (USNM 60.85) is
silver; a third (USNM 59.2004) is copper. The silver
button, &#8542; inch in diameter, could be one of two
dozen vest buttons bought by Mercer for 18 pence
each in 1741. A brass button with silver surface was
roll-plated in the Sheffield manner (USNM 59.2004),
thus placing its date at some time after 1762. &#8220;White
metal&#8221;&mdash;a white brass&mdash;was commonly used for
buttons in the 18th century, and is seen here in a fragmentary
specimen (USNM 59.2004). One hollow
button of sheet brass shows the remains of gilding
(USNM 60.73). Only one example was found&mdash;a
dark-gray shell button&mdash;that was used on under-garments
(USNM 59.1819).</p>

Four thimbles, mentioned in Ledger B, were purchased
in 1729, and four in 1731.)</p>

<p>Parts of a penknife that were found consist of ivory-casing
fragments, steel frame, knife blade, single-tined

Two chalk marbles attest to the early appeal of that
traditional game, as well as to the ingenuity that went
into making the marbles of this material (USNM
59.1682). Chalk also was used to make a bullet mold,
half of which, bearing an M on the side, has survived
(USNM 59.1682, <a href="#Fig_84">fig. 84b</a>, <a href="#Dr_51">ill. 51</a>). A musket ball
(USNM 59.1682) from the site could have been made
in it. Two gun flints (USNM 59.1629 and 59.1647,
<a href="#Fig_84">fig. 84a</a>) are of white chert.</p>

<p>An English halfpenny, dated 1787, was found near

(USNM 59.2041, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83c</a>). Considerably worn, it
may have been dropped after the destruction of the
building. Two fragments of flat slate were found

slate pencil (USNM 59.1685, <a href="#Fig_85">fig. 85</a>, <a href="#Dr_54">ill. 54</a>). It is
clear that slates were used at Marlborough, probably
when Mercer&#8217;s children were receiving their education
from the plantation tutors.</p>

<p>As usual in colonial sites, quantities of pipestem
and bowl fragments were recovered. Virtually all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157" name="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a><br /><a id="Page_158" name="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the bowls reflect the typical Georgian-period white-clay
pipe form, with only minor variations. Most of
the stems have bores ranging from <sup>4</sup>/<sub>64</sub> inch (1750-1800)
to <sup>6</sup>/<sub>64</sub> inch (1650-1750). A single stem fragment
from a terra cotta pipe of a kind found at Jamestown
and Kecoughtan, probably dropped by an Indian or
early white trader, is early 17th century (<a href="#Fig_84">fig. 84f</a>),
while two white-clay stem fragments have bores of
&#8539; inch (1620-1650). A fragment of a pipe bowl has
molded decoration in relief, with what appear to be
masonic emblems framed on a vine wreath (USNM
59.2003, <a href="#Dr_52">ill. 52</a>).</p>

<p>Mercer, as we have seen, had a lavish supply of
plate. Little of this, understandably, was likely to
have been thrown away or lost, except for an occasional
piece of flatware. One such exception is a
teaspoon from the Structure B foundation (USNM
59.1827, <a href="#Fig_86">fig. 86</a>). It has a typical early Georgian
form&mdash;ribbed handle, elliptical bowl, and leaf-drop
handle attachment on back of the bowl. As in the
case of small objects worked after the marks were
applied, this has evidence of two distorted marks.
Corrosion has obliterated such details as may have
been visible originally, although there are fairly clear
indications of the leopard&#8217;s head crowned and lion
passant found on London silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Table cutlery.</span>&mdash;Fragmentary knives and forks
from the site date mostly from before 1750. Forks are
all of the long, double-tine variety. One, which may
date back to the second half of the 17th century, has
a delicate shank, widening to a tooled, decorative
band, with shaft extending downward which was
originally enclosed in a handle of horn, bone, or wood
(USNM 59.1663, <a href="#Dr_55">ill. 55</a>). A fragment of a narrow-bladed
knife (USNM 59.1882, <a href="#Fig_85">fig. 85</a>) may be of the
same period as the fork. Two forks, each with one
long tine intact, show evidence of having had flat
cores for wood or silver handles (USNM 59.2029,
59.1939, <a href="#Dr_56">ills. 56</a> and <a href="#Dr_57">57</a>). The shanks, differing in
length from each other, are turned in an ogee shape.
Three blades, varying in completeness, are of the
curved type used with &#8220;pistol-grip&#8221; handles (USNM
59.1667-1668, 59.1939). A straight blade fragment
(USNM 59.1999) is probably contemporary with
them. Only two knife fragments (USNM 59.1799
and 59.2082) appear to be 19th century (<a href="#Fig_85">fig. 85</a>).</p>

<p>One of the most unusual artifacts is a half section
of a hollow Sheffield-plated pistol-grip knife handle.
Sheffield plate was introduced in 1742 by a process
that fused sheets of silver to sheets of copper under
heat and pressure.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The metal, as here, was

<p>Three, whole pewter spoons, as well as several fragments
of spoons, were salvaged from the large trash
pit (Structure D). Two whole specimens and a fragment
of a third are trifid-handle spoons cast in a mold
that was probably made about 1690. One of these
(USNM 59.1669, <a href="#Fig_86">fig. 86g</a>, <a href="#Dr_58">ill. 58</a>) has had two holes
bored at the top of the handle, probably to enable the
user to secure it by a cord to his person or to hang it
from a loop. This circumstance, plus the presence of
such an early type of spoon in an 18th-century context,
suggests that the spoons were made during the Mercer
period for kitchen or slave use from a mold dating
back to the Port Town period. The spoons themselves
may, of course, have survived from the Port
Town time and have been relegated to humble use on
the plantation.</p>

<p>A somewhat later spoon, with &#8220;wavy-end&#8221; handle,
comes from a mold of about 1710. It has the initial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161" name="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
N scratched on the handle (USNM 59.1672, <a href="#Fig_86">fig. 86e</a>,
<a href="#Dr_59">ill. 59</a>). Another fragmentary example has a late type
of wavy-end handle, dating perhaps ten years later
(USNM 59.1672).</p>

<p>A pewter teapot lid with tooled rim and the remains
of a finial may be as early as 1740 (USNM 59.1676,
<a href="#Fig_86">fig. 86c</a>, <a href="#Dr_60">ill. 60</a>). Two rim fragments of a pewter plate
also were found (USNM 59.1675, <a href="#Fig_86">fig. 86a</a>).</p>


<p class="title">KITCHEN AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cutler&#8217;s work.</span>&mdash;In 1725 Mercer bought a pair of
&#8220;Salisbury Scissors&#8221;; there is no clue as to what is
meant by the adjectival place name. He purchased
another pair of scissors in 1744. In any case, a pair
of embroidery scissors, with turned decoration that
one would expect to find on early 18th-century scissors,
was found in the site (USNM 59.1680, <a href="#Dr_61">ill. 61</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ironware.</span>&mdash;Pieces of two types of iron pot were
found. One type is a large-capacity version, holding
possibly five gallons. It has horizontal ribbing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162" name="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
vertical mold seams (USNM 59.1645, 59.1845,
59.60.147, <a href="#Fig_87">fig. 87</a>). Such, perhaps, was the &#8220;gr[ea]t
pot&#8221; weighing 36 pounds which Mercer bought from
Nathaniel Chapman of the Accokeek Iron Works in
1731. Two other fragments are from a smaller pot.
The inventory taken in 1771 (<a href="#Page_211">Appendix M</a>) lists five
&#8220;Iron Potts for Negroes,&#8221; that were probably smaller
than those used in the plantation kitchen.</p>

<p>Two heaters for box irons were found in the kitchen
debris. A heavy layer of mortar adhered to one,
suggesting that it may have been built into the
brickwork&mdash;whether by accident or design there is
no way of telling. In that case, however, the specimen
would antedate 1749 (USNM 59.2024, 59.2026, <a href="#Fig_87">fig.
87</a>). Box irons were hollow flatirons into which pre-heated
cast-iron slugs or &#8220;heaters&#8221; were inserted.
Two or more heaters were rotated in the fire, one
always being ready to replace the other as it cooled.
In 1725 Mercer bought a &#8220;box Iron &amp; heaters,&#8221;
and in 1731, from Chapman, &#8220;2 heaters.&#8221;</p>

in the metal of the blade: &#8220;SHEFFIELD

inches to 1&frac14; inches. On tubular ring (USNM 60.53,
<a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83</a>) may have been used as a curtain ring, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163" name="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
signs of wear suggest that it perhaps may have been
a drawer pull. A small, brass, circular escutcheon
(USNM 59.1735, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83</a>) comes from a teardrop-handle
fixture of the William and Mary style. A
round keyhole escutcheon has tooled grooves and
holes for four nails (USNM 59.1630, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83</a>), and
dates from about 1750. The handsomest specimen of
furniture trim found is an escutcheon plate with
engraved linear decoration dating from about 1720
(USNM 60.71, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83</a>). An iron bale handle was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164" name="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a><br /><a id="Page_165" name="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
probably on a trunk or chest (USNM 60.130, <a href="#Fig_88">fig.

is like those found on the lids of 18th-century wooden
chests, while a butt hinge may have served on the

<p>Iron was a fundamental material in the construction
of any 18th-century building. Mercer&#8217;s ledgers make
repeated references to the purchase of hinges, locks,
latches, and other related iron equipment. Most
of this material was obtained from local merchants and
was probably English in origin. However, the ledger
records numerous purchases from Nathaniel Chapman
of iron that was undoubtedly made at his ironworks.
It is probable also that many simple appliances were
made at Marlborough by slaves or indentured servants
trained as blacksmiths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hinges.</span>&mdash;Hand-forged strap hinges were employed
throughout the colonies from the first period of settlement
to the middle of the 19th century. In addition
to the many fragments that probably came from such
hinges, one artifact is a typical spearhead strap-hinge
terminal with a square hole for nailing (USNM 60.146,
<a href="#Dr_67">ill. 64</a>). Three pintles&mdash;L-shaped pivots on which
strap hinges swung&mdash;were recovered. One was found
at the site of a gate or door in the wall south of the
kitchen (USNM 60.59, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88l</a>).</p>

<p>Fragments from at least four different H and HL
hinges occur. Several entries in the ledgers refer to
the purchase of such hinges. A nearly complete HL
hinge, probably used on a large door, recalls an item
in the account with Charles Dick for June 14, 1744,
&#8220;2 p<sup>r</sup> large hinges 9/&#8221; (USNM 59.1945, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88</a>). A
piece of a smaller H or HL hinge is of the type used
on interior doors (USNM 59.1767, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88</a>), while a
still smaller section of an H hinge was perhaps used
on a cupboard door. H hinges were more properly
known as &#8220;side hinges,&#8221; and we find Mercer using that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166" name="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
term in 1729 when he bought a pair of &#8220;Sidehinges&#8221;
for 9d. &#8220;Cross-garnet&#8221; hinges, where a sharply
tapering, spear-headed strap section is pivoted by a
pin inserted in a stationary, rectangular butt section,
are represented by three imperfect specimens (USNM
59.1657 and 59.1881, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88</a>). Both these types are
named, described, and illustrated by Moxon.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Locks, Latches, and Keys.</span>&mdash;Only one remnant of
the ubiquitous 18th-century &#8220;Suffolk&#8221; thumb-press
door latch was found at Marlborough. This fragment
comprises the handle but not the cusps at the
ends, by which the age might be determined (USNM
60.137, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88</a>). Mercer purchased an &#8220;Iron door
latch&#8221; from Nathaniel Chapman for ninepence in
1731. In a complete assemblage for these latches,
a thumb press lifts a latch bar on the reverse side
of the door, disengaging it from a catch driven into
the edge of the jamb. One large latch bar was
recovered (USNM 59.1972, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88f</a>), as well as two
catches (USNM 59.1644, fig. <a href="#Fig_88">88i</a>, and 59.1801, <a href="#Dr_65">ill.
65</a>). Sliding bolts were the usual locking devices when
simple thumb latches were used. A survival of one
of these is seen in a short iron rod with a shorter
segment of rod attached to it at right angles (USNM
59.1942, <a href="#Dr_69">ill. 69</a>).</p>

<p>Purchases of padlocks are recorded, but there is no
archeological evidence for them. However, a well-made
hasp (USNM 59.1655, <a href="#Dr_66">ill. 66</a>) has survived, and
also three staples (USNM 59.1644, 59.1659, 59.2027,
<a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88j</a>). Mercer bought six staples in 1742 at a
penny each.</p>

<p>Apparently the principal doors of both the 1730<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167" name="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
house and the mansion were fitted with box locks, or
&#8220;stock-locks,&#8221; in which wood and iron were usually
combined. A heavy iron plate comes from such a
lock (USNM 59.1943, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88</a>). Two stock-locks were
bought from John Foward in 1731. Another was
purchased from William Hunter in 1741. In the
same year Mercer acquired from Charles Dick &#8220;8
Chamberdoor Locks w<sup>th</sup> brass knobs.&#8221; If by knob
was meant a drop handle, then a fine brass specimen
may be one of these (USNM 59.1944, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83h</a>, <a href="#Dr_67">ill. 67</a>).
Fragments of three iron keys have survived, the
smallest of which may have been used with a furniture
lock (USNM 59.1644 and 59.1656, <a href="#Fig_88">fig. 88h</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nails and Spikes.</span>&mdash;The ledgers point to a constant
purchasing of nails which is reflected in the great
quantity recovered from the excavations. A 1731
purchase from Chapman comprised 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-,
8-, 10-, 12-, and 20-penny nails, while in the 1740&#8217;s
not only nails but 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-penny brads were
purchased, as well as 20-penny flooring brads.
Excepting the last, nearly all these sizes occur in the
artifacts. There is also a variety of heavy spikes,
ranging from 3 inches to 7 inches in length (see <a href="#Dr_70">ills.
70</a>-<a href="#Dr_73">73</a>).</p>

<p class="title">HANDCRAFT TOOLS</p>

<p>Marlborough, like most 18th-century plantations,
was to a large extent self-sufficient, and therefore it is
not surprising to find handtools of several kinds. A
blacksmith&#8217;s hammer (USNM 59.2081, <a href="#Dr_74">ill. 74</a>), for
example, strengthens the view that there may have
been blacksmiths at Marlborough. Other tools include
a smoothing-plane blade of iron with a 1-inch
steel tip (USNM 59.1897, <a href="#Fig_89">fig. 89a</a>); a set wrench for a
&frac34;-inch square nut or bolt (possibly for bed bolts),
equipped originally with a wooden handle (USNM
60.91, <a href="#Dr_75">ill. 75</a>); a steel scraping tool or chisel with
handle set at an angle (USNM 60.133, <a href="#Fig_89">fig. 89b</a>, <a href="#Dr_76">ill.
76</a>); a small half-round bit or gouge chisel (USNM
59.1644, <a href="#Fig_89">fig. 89c</a>, <a href="#Dr_77">ill. 77</a>). Three crude lengths of
iron with stubby L-shaped ends appear to be work-bench
dogs (<a href="#Fig_89">fig. 89f</a>).</p>

<p>One fine tool is from the equipment of a jeweler or a
clockmaker (USNM 59.1664, <a href="#Dr_78">ill. 78</a>). It is a very
small hammer with a turned, bell-shaped striking
head. Originally balanced by a sharp wing-shaped
peen, which was, however, badly rusted and which
disintegrated soon after being found, the tool has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168" name="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
tubular, tinned, sheet-iron shaft handle which is
secured by a brass ferrule to the head and brazed
together with brass. The lower end is plugged with
brass, where a longer handle perhaps was attached.
In 1748 Sydenham &amp; Hodgson, through William Jordan,
imported for Mercer &#8220;A Sett Clockmakers tools.&#8221;
This entry is annotated, &#8220;Return&#8217;d to M<sup>r</sup> Jordan.&#8221;
Although the hammer cannot be related to this particular
set of tools, the ledger item suggests that fine
work like clockmaking may have been conducted at
Marlborough. This tool may have been used in the
process.</p>

<p>The 1771 inventory is in some ways a more significant
summary of 18th-century plantation equipment
than are the artifacts found at Marlborough, since
its list of tools is longer than the list of tool artifacts
and is pin-pointed in time. However, artifacts define
themselves concretely and imply far more of such
matters as workmanship, suitability to purpose,
source of origin, or design and form, than do mere
names. The Marlborough tools and equipment,
moreover, correspond, as far as they go, very closely
with the items in the inventory, thus becoming
actualities experienced by us tactually and visually.</p>

<p>For instance, the inventory lists 22 plows at Marlborough.
Among the finds is an iron colter from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169" name="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
colonial plow in which the colter was suspended from
the beam and locked into the top of the share (USNM
60.88, <a href="#Dr_79">ill. 79</a>). The colter is bent and torn from
exhaustive use (Chapman, in 1731, fitted a plow &#8220;w<sup>th</sup>
Iron&#8221; for Mercer). From it we learn a good deal
about the size of the plow on which it was used and
the shallow depth of the furrows it made.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 475px;">
<a id="Fig_91" name="Fig_91"></a>
<img src="images/i_381.png" width="475" height="380" alt="" title="Farm gear" />
<span class="caption">Figure 91.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Farm gear</span>: a, part of collapsible-top fitting from carriage; b, chain, probably
from whiffletree; c, part of bridle bit; d, iron stiffener from a saddle; e, worn chain link;

two horseshoes; and k, chain to which a strap was attached&mdash;probably harness gear.</span>
</div>

<p>Four chain traces were on the list, one of which is
represented by a length of flat links attached to a
triangular loop to which the leather portion of the
traces was fastened (USNM 60.64, <a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91b</a>). The
halves of two snaffle bits (USNM 59.2078, 60.67, <a href="#Fig_91">fig.
91c</a>; <a href="#Dr_87">ill. 87</a>) correspond to an item for eight &#8220;Bridle
Bitts.&#8221; (A &#8220;snafflebit&#8221; costing 1s. 8d. was among
Mercer&#8217;s purchases for 1743.) A third bit, crudely
made of twisted wire attached to odd-sized rings, is a
makeshift device probably dating from the 19th
century. Three ox chains listed in the inventory are
not distinctly in evidence in the artifacts, although a
heavy hook, broken at the shank, is of the type used
to fasten an ox chain to the yoke (USNM 60.9, <a href="#Dr_80">ill. 80</a>).</p>

<p>Archeological evidence of the two oxcarts and one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170" name="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wagon listed in the inventory is confined to nuts and
bolts that might have been used on such vehicles. A
long axle bolt (USNM 59.1802) measures 23 inches.
A small bolt or staple, split at one end and threaded
at the other, has a wingnut (USNM 60.145, <a href="#Dr_81">ill. 81</a>).
A hook with a heavy, diamond-shaped backplate and
a bolt hole was perhaps used on a wagon to secure
lashing (USNM 59.2030, <a href="#Dr_82">ill. 82</a>). A heavy, curved
piece of iron with a large hole, probably for a clevice
pin, appears to be from the end of a wagon tongue,
while a carefully made bolt with hand-hammered
head (USNM 59.1821) and a short rivet with washer
(USNM 59.1881, <a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91g</a>) in place seem also to be
vehicle parts.</p>

<p>The inventory listed four complete harnesses, the
remains of which are probably to be found in four
square iron buckles (USNM 59.1644, 59.1901, 60.131,
<a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91h</a>), a brass ring (USNM 59.1678, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83</a>), and

</div>

<p>Twelve &#8220;Swingle trees&#8221; (whippletree, whiffletree,
singletree) are listed in the inventory. The artifacts
include three iron loops or straps designed to be
secured to the swingletrees. One (USNM 59.2042,
<a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91b</a>) still has two large round links attached.
(In 1731 Chapman fitted ironwork to a swingletree.)</p>

<p>Ten &#8220;Hillinghows,&#8221; 17 &#8220;Weeding hows,&#8221; and 8
&#8220;Grubbing hows&#8221; are listed. In the long Chapman
account for 1731 we see that Mercer then purchased
&#8220;5 narrow hoes&#8221; and &#8220;2 grubbing hoes.&#8221; The only
archeological evidence of hoes is a fragmentary broad
hoe (probably a hilling hoe) (USNM 59.1848, <a href="#Dr_83">ill. 83</a>)
and the collar of another.</p>

<p>Thirteen axes are listed in the inventory. Again
we find Nathaniel Chapman providing a &#8220;new axe&#8221;
in 1731 for five shillings, while William Hunter sold
Mercer &#8220;2 narrow axes&#8221; and &#8220;4 Axes&#8221; in 1743. One
broken ax head occurs among the artifacts, worn
back from repeated grinding and split at the eye
(USNM 59.1740, <a href="#Fig_89">fig. 89e</a>).</p>

<p>There were four spades and an iron shovel at Marlborough
in 1771. An iron reinforcement from a
shovel handle occurred in the site (USNM 59.1847,
<a href="#Dr_84">ill. 84</a>), while a slightly less curved strip of iron may
have been attached to a spade handle (USNM 59.1662).
Once more in Chapman&#8217;s account we find evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171" name="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
local workmanship in an item for &#8220;1 Spade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thirteen scythes were listed in 1771; perhaps the one
excavated from the foundation of Structure H on
Potomac Creek may have been among these (USNM
59.2400, <a href="#Fig_90">fig. 90</a>). There were eight sheep shears;
half of a sheep shears was found in Structure G
(USNM 59.1734, <a href="#Dr_85">ill. 85</a>). Of the other items on the
list, a few, such as stock locks and hammers, have
already been mentioned, while the remainder of the
list is not matched by artifacts. An item for a chalk-line
is supported by a piece of chalk (USNM 59.1683,
<a href="#Fig_84">fig. 84</a>).</p>

<p>A few specimens are not matched in the inventory.
One is a springtrap of hand-forged, hand-riveted iron
(USNM 59.1715, <a href="#Dr_86">ill. 86</a>) for catching animals.
Another is a fishhook (USNM 59.1681, <a href="#Dr_88">ill. 88</a>), possibly
one of 95 bought in 1744. An iron stiffener for
the framework of a saddle is fitted with 10 rivets for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172" name="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
securing the leather and upholstery (USNM 59.1847,
<a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91d</a>). The third artifact is an elegantly designed
brass fitting for a leather curtain or strap (USNM
59.1736, <a href="#Fig_83">fig. 83j</a>, <a href="#Dr_89">ill. 89</a>). It is fitted with a copper
rivet at the stationary end for securing leather or
cloth; just below the rivet is a recessed groove and
shelf, perhaps to receive a reinforced edge; to the
lower part of this is hinged a long handle cut in a leaf
design. An iron hinge bar is part of the equipment
for folding back the top of a chaise (USNM 60.178,
<a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91a</a>). There are several horseshoes, two whole
shoes and numerous fragments (<a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91i and j</a>).
Finally, the handle shaft and decorative attachment
of an iron currycomb (USNM 59.2077, <a href="#Fig_91">fig. 91f</a>)
recalls Mercer&#8217;s purchase of &#8220;1 curry comb and
brush&#8221; in 1726.</p>

<i>Conclusions</i></h3>


<p>Almost no exclusively 17th century artifacts were
found at Marlborough; at least, there were very few
sherds or objects that could not have originated
equally well in the 18th century. The exceptions are
the following: Westerwald blue-and-white stoneware
with gray-buff paste; several sherds of delft and
other tin-enameled ware, late 17th century in type,
and an early 17th-century terra cotta pipestem.
Otherwise, we find a scattering of things belonging
to types that occurred in both centuries: North Devon
gravel-tempered ware, which was imported both in
the late 17th and early 18th centuries; yellow-and-brown
&#8220;combed&#8221; ware, which elsewhere occurs most
commonly in 18th century contexts; pewter trifid-handle
spoons, the form of which dates from about
1690 but which may have been cast at a later date
in an old mold (a wavy-end spoon in the style of
1710 may also have been cast later). Fragments of
an onion-shaped wine bottle may date from the first
decade of the 18th century, but the presence of such
bottles in the Rosewell trash pit shows that bottles,
being too precious to throw away, were kept around
until they were broken&mdash;in the case of Rosewell
for 60 or 70 years. Thus the Marlborough sherds
cannot be excluded from the Mercer period. The
same may be said of a late 17th-century type of
fork. Thus, there is virtually no evidence of the Port
Town occupation, especially as the few 17th-century
artifacts that were found may well have belonged to
the Mercers rather than to Marlborough&#8217;s previous
occupants.</p>

<p>The ceramics and glass are the most readily datable
artifacts, and these coincide almost altogether with
the period of John Mercer&#8217;s lifetime. Common
earthenwares are predominantly Tidewater and
Buckley types, with a scattering of others, most of
which are recurrent among other Virginia and
Maryland historic-site artifacts. No distinct type
emerges to suggest that there may have been a local
Stafford potter. Common stonewares occur in such
a variety of types that no source or date can be
attributed, although there is some evidence of the
work of William Rogers&#8217; shop in Yorktown. Westerwald
stonewares are predominantly of the blue-and-gray
varieties commonest in the second quarter of the
18th century.</p>

<p>There is only a small quantity of delftware, but a
great deal of Chinese porcelain. Evidences are that
the first kinds of English refined wares, such as drab
stoneware, Nottingham stoneware, and agateware,
were used at Marlborough, thus pointing to an
awareness of current tastes and innovations. The
large quantity of white salt-glazed ware suggests that,
although it was a cheap commercial product, it was
regarded as handsome and congenial to the environment
of a plantation house that was maintained in
formal style.</p>

<p>Except for the white salt-glazed ware, which was
probably acquired in the 1760&#8217;s, most of the table
ceramics date from about 1740 to 1760. Bottles and
the few datable table-glass fragments are also primarily
from this period. Creamwares and late
18th- and early 19th-century whitewares diminish
sharply in numbers, reflecting a more austere life at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174" name="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Marlborough in its descent to an overseer&#8217;s quarters.
Later 19th-century wares are insignificant in quantity
or in their relation to the history of Marlborough.
Tool and hardware forms are less diagnostic. Most of
them correspond to ledger entries and to the 1771
inventory, so, without contradictory evidence, they
may be assumed to date from John Mercer&#8217;s period.</p>

<p>In general, the artifacts illustrate the best of household
equipment available in 18th-century Virginia,
and the tools and hardware indicate the extensiveness
of the plantation&#8217;s activities and its heavy reliance
on blacksmith work.</p>

<h3>XX<br />
<br />
<i>Summary of Findings</i></h3>

<p>Marlborough&#8217;s beginnings as a town in 1691 cast
the shape that has endured in a few vestiges even until
today. The original survey of Bland and Buckner
remains as evidence, and by it we are led to believe
that the courthouse was located near the &#8220;Gutt&#8221; to
the west of the town, near a change of course that
affected the western boundary and all the north-south
streets west of George Andrews&#8217; lots. Archeological
excavation in the area disclosed Structure B, which
subsequent evidence proved to be the foundation of
Mercer&#8217;s mansion, built at the pinnacle of his career
between 1746 and 1750. No evidence exists that this
foundation was associated earlier with the courthouse.</p>

<p>Two years after the second Act for Ports was passed
in 1705, the second survey was made and was lost
soon thereafter. There is evidence that the house
built by William Ballard in 1708, on a lot &#8220;ditched in&#8221;
according to this plat, was also in the vicinity of the
courthouse. After Mercer moved into this house in
1726, it became clear that the two surveys were at
odds, and a new survey was ordered and made in
1731. The maneuvers which followed make it fairly
clear that Mercer&#8217;s residence was encroaching upon
the two acres that had been set aside for the courthouse,
which by Act of Assembly had reverted to the
heirs of Giles Brent after the courthouse had burned
and been abandoned about 1718. The 1731 plat provided
a whole new row of lots along the western
boundary of the town, while pushing the original lots
slightly to the east. This device would have assured
the integrity of the courthouse land, while relieving
Mercer of the uncertainty of his title. When Mercer&#8217;s
petition to acquire Marlborough was submitted in
1747 (the 1731 plat still remained unaccepted), he
offered to buy the courthouse land for three times its
worth. Since Mercer was guardian of the heir,
&#8220;Mr. William Brent, the Infant,&#8221; he was called upon
to testify in this capacity at the hearings on his petition.
Thus the courthouse, Ballard&#8217;s house, and Mercer&#8217;s
mansion all appear to have been involved in a boundary
difficulty, and we may assume, therefore, that
the courthouse during its brief career stood close to
the spot where Mercer later built his mansion.</p>

<p>This difficulty, in particular, was influential in
determining the shape of the town, the manner in
which Mercer developed the property and the peculiarities
that made Marlborough unique. It was not
until 1755 that he was permitted to acquire all the
town and by that time Marlborough&#8217;s character had
already been fixed. We have seen that its outstanding
feature, the mansion, was architecturally sophisticated,
that leading craftsmen worked on it, and that it was
as highly individualistic as its master. It was lavishly
furnished not only with material elegancies but with
a library embracing more than a thousand volumes.</p>

<p>Aside from the mansion, the area most actively
developed by Mercer lay between it and Potomac
Creek, with some construction to the north and the
east. In 1731, Mercer built two warehouses which
probably stood near the waterside at Potomac Creek
where his sloop and schooner and visiting vessels found
sheltered anchorage. These burned in 1746, but must
subsequently have been rebuilt, since Thomas Oliver
in his 1771 report to James Mercer commented that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178" name="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the &#8220;tobacco houses&#8221; must be repaired as soon as
possible. They were probably among the buildings
that Mercer had constructed up to 1747, when he
reported that he had &#8220;saved&#8221; 17 of the town&#8217;s lots by
building on them. These lots comprised 8&frac12; acres in
the southwest portion of the town.</p>

<p>The windmill was built on land near the river shore,
east of the mansion. It was probably located a considerable
distance from the shore, although erosion in
recent times has eaten back the cliff. In the fall of
1958, half of the stone foundations collapsed, leaving
a well-defined profile of the stone construction.
Fragments of mid-century-type wine bottles found in
the lower course of the stones support other evidence
that the mill was built in 1746.</p>

<p>Mercer mentioned his &#8220;office&#8221; in 1766. This may
have been a detached building used for a law office.
Oliver in 1771 listed a barn, a cider mill, two &#8220;grainerys,&#8221;
three cornhouses, five stables, and tobacco
houses. He mentioned also that &#8220;the East Green
House wants repairing, the west d<sup>o</sup> wants buttments
as a security to the wall on the south side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides the malthouse and brewhouse built in 1765
(which may have been situated at Structure H and
the 100-foot-long stone-wall enclosure attached to Wall
A), John Mercer in his 1768 letter mentioned &#8220;Cellars,
Cooper&#8217;s house and all the buildings, copper &amp; utensil
whatever used about the brewery,&#8221; as well as the
&#8220;neat warm&#8221; house built for the brewer. When the
property was advertised in 1791, &#8220;Overseers houses,&#8221;
&#8220;Negroe quarters,&#8221; and &#8220;Corn houses&#8221; also were
mentioned.</p>

<p>The development of the area in the southwest
portion of the plantation probably sustained&mdash;or
established for the first time&mdash;the character originally
intended for Marlborough Town. The situation of
the mansion was undoubtedly affected by this, as
indeed must have been the whole plantation plan.
The archeological evidence alone shows that the plan
was abnormal in terms of the typical 18th-century
Virginia plantation. The rectangular enclosure
formed by the brick walls east of the mansion doubtless
framed the formal garden over which the imported
English gardener, William Black, presided. It
connected at the northwest with the kitchen in such
a way that the kitchen formed a corner of the enclosure,
becoming in effect a gatehouse, protecting
the mansion&#8217;s privacy at the northwest from the
utilitarian slave quarter and agricultural precincts
beyond. Walls A-I and A-II, however, related the
mansion directly to this plantation-business area and
caused it to serve also as a gate to the enclosure.</p>

<p>The position of the kitchen dependency northwest
of the house is the only suggestion of Palladian layout,
other than the garden. The southern aspect of the
house and the rigid boundary to domestic activity
imposed by Walls A-I and A-II probably prevented
construction of a balancing unit to the southwest.
Slave quarters, stables, and perhaps the barn apparently
were located to the north.</p>

<p>Since it was not until 1755 that Mercer came into
full title to the town, the town plan and its legal
restrictions were influential in determining the way
in which the plantation was to grow. The house and
the surrounding layout were, therefore, wholly peculiar
to the special circumstances of Marlborough and
probably also to the individuality of its owner. The
approach to the house from the waterside was to the
south end of the building, leading up to it by the
still-existing road from the creek and along the old
&#8220;Broad Street across the Town,&#8221; which probably
bordered Walls A-I and B-I. The mansion thus
had a little of the character of a feudal manor house,
as well as some of the appearance of an English
townhouse that abuts the street, with the seclusion of
its yards and gardens defended by walls. In many
respects it only slightly resembled, in its relationship
to surrounding structures, the more representative
plantations of its period.</p>

<p>The house was well oriented to view, ventilation,
and dominant location. The veranda, which afforded
communication from one part to another out-of-doors,
as well as a place to sit, was exposed to the prevailing
southwesterly summer winds. In the winter it was
equally well placed so as to be in the lee of northeast
storms sweeping down the Potomac. The view,
hidden today by trees, included Accokeek Creek and
a lengthy vista up Potomac Creek. Presumably,
a road or driveway skirted the kitchen at the west and
perhaps ended in a driveway in front of the house.
The gate in Wall E south of the kitchen would have
been a normal entrance for horses and vehicles.</p>

<p>Within the garden was the summerhouse built by
Mercer in 1765. From the east windows and steps
of the house and from the garden could be seen the
Potomac, curving towards the bay, and the flailing
&#8220;drivers&#8221; of the windmill near the Potomac shore.</p>

<p>The excavated and written records of Marlborough
are a microcosm of Virginia colonial history. They
depict the emergence of central authority in the 17th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179" name="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
century in the establishment of the port town as a
device to diversify the economy and control the collecting
of duties. In the failure of the town, they
demonstrate also the failure of colonial government to
overcome the tyranny of tobacco and the restrictive
policies of the mother country. They go on to show
in great detail the emergence in the 18th century of
a familiar American theme&mdash;the self-directed rise of
an individual from obscure beginnings to high professional
rank, social leadership, personal wealth, and
cultural influence. They demonstrate in Mercer&#8217;s
career the inherent defects of the tobacco economy as
indebtedness mounted and economic strains stiffened.
In Mercer&#8217;s concern with the Ohio Company and
westward expansion they reflect a colony-wide trend
as population increased and the need grew for more
arable land and areas in which to invest and escape
from economic limitations. They show that the war
with the French inevitably ensued, with its demands
on income and manpower, while following this came
the enforcement of trade laws and the immediate
irritants which led to rebellion. So Marlborough
gives a sharp reflection of Virginia&#8217;s history prior to
the Revolution. It was touched by most of what was
typical and significant in the period, yet in its own
details it was unique and individual. In this seeming
anomaly Marlborough is a true illustration of its age,
when men like Mercer were strong individuals but at
the same time typifying and expressing the milieu in
which they lived.</p>

<p>Mercer&#8217;s rise to wealth and leadership occurred at
a time when favorable laws held out the promise of
prosperity, while boundless lands offered unparalleled
opportunities for investment. It remained for those
best able to take advantage of the situation; Mercer&#8217;s
self-training in the law, his driving energy, and his
ability to organize placed him among these. The
importance of his position is signified by the justice-ship
that he held for so many years in Stafford County
court; the brick courthouse on the hill overlooking
the upper reaches of Potomac Creek was the architectural
symbol of this position. Although most of his
income was derived from legal practice, it was his
plantation that was the principal expression of his
interests and his energies. Mercer was in this respect
typical of his peers, whose intellectual and professional
leadership, on the one hand, and agricultural and
business enterprise, on the other, formed a partnership
within the individual. The great plantation house
with its sophisticated elegancies, its outward formalities,
and its rich resort for the intellect in the form of
a varied library, was the center and spirit of the society
of which men like Mercer were leaders. With the
death of the system came the death of the great house,
and the rise and fall of Marlborough symbolizes, as
well as anything can, the life cycle of Virginia&#8217;s
colonial plantation order.</p>

Inventory of Marlborough, 1771</h3>

<p>[John Mercer&#8217;s widow, Ann Roy Mercer, died at
Marlborough September 2, 1770. By the next
spring, James Mercer was operating Marlborough
as one of four plantations owned by him. The
overseer was Thomas Oliver. At the end of May
1771 Oliver drew up a statement of the conditions of
the plantations and made a detailed inventory.
This document has been reproduced in facsimile in
<i>A Documentary History of American Industrial Society</i>.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The following excerpts consist of the inventory,
as it applied to Marlborough only, and of Oliver&#8217;s
statement at the end. The &#8220;return,&#8221; as he called it,
covered the period from May 1 to May 31, 1771.
The reference to advertising the &#8220;sale&#8221; is apparently
concerned with one of the unsuccessful public sales
of John Mercer&#8217;s personal property.]</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
